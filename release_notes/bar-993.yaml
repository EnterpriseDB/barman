- summary: Deprecate custom compression for WAL files
  description: |
    The `custom` compression option and its related configuration options
    (`custom_compression_filter`, `custom_decompression_filter`, and
    `custom_compression_magic`) have been deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release.

    Users currently using custom compression are advised to migrate to one of the
    built-in compression algorithms supported by Barman: `gzip`, `bzip2`, `lz4`,
    `xz`, `zstd`, or `pigz`.

    The custom compression feature was designed to provide flexibility for users
    with specific compression requirements, but maintaining compatibility with
    arbitrary external compression tools has proven to be complex and error-prone.
    The built-in compression options provide better performance, reliability, and
    maintainability.

    Existing configurations using custom compression will continue to work in the
    current release, but users should plan to migrate their configurations before
    the feature is removed.
