- summary: Add lz4 compression for WAL files
  description: |
    Introduced support for lz4 compression on WAL files. It can be enabled by
    specifying `lz4` in the `compression` server parameter. It can also be specified
    using the --lz4 command line argument in barman-wal-restore to compress WAL files
    at restore time. Lastly, a --lz4 command line argument was also added to
    barman-cloud-wal-archive for compression on cloud uploads.
