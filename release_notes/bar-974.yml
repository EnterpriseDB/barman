- summary: Increase coverage of non-compliant S3 object stores for backup deletion
  description: |
    With this fix we increase the coverage of non-compliant S3 object stores for backup
    deletion.

    We've reduced the expression we were matching for the message returned on failure
    to catch any error code that returns a message that contains "content-MD5".

    We believe with this, almost all non-compliant S3 object stores for backup deletion
    will be covered
