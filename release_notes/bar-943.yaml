- summary: Add `--recovery-option-port` to `barman restore` command
  description: |
    When doing a remote restore with `get-wal` mode, Barman writes a `restore_command`
    which invokes `barman-wal-restore` to fetch WALs. However, there was currently no
    way to specify a custom port to the written `barman-wal-restore` command.

    This change introduces the `--recovery-option-port` flag to the `barman restore`
    command, allowing users to specify a value for the `--port` option of
    `barman-wal-restore` command during remote restores.
