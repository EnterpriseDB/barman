- summary: Fix `pg_combinebackup` not being found in `PATH` when `staging_location` is `remote`
  description: |
    When recovering an incremental backup to a remote server with `staging_location`
    set to `remote`, Barman checks if `pg_combinebackup` is available in the remote `PATH`.
    However, a previous issue was making it incorrectly check the local `PATH` as well,
    leading to errors if `pg_combinebackup` was not installed locally.
    The problem has been fixed by ensuring that the check is only performed on the
    server where `pg_combinebackup` is actually executed.
