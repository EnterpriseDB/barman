- summary: Add delta-restore flag and recovery option to barman restore
  description: |
    Introduces the --delta-restore flag for barman restore, enabling delta
    restore mode. This mode restores a backup by reusing identical data already present
    in the destination directory, which drastically reduces restore time and network
    traffic.

    This feature is also configurable per-server via 'recovery_options' as a new field
    called delta-restore in the server configuration file.
