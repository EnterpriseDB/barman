- summary: Add --keep-compression flag to barman-wal-restore and get-wal
  description: |
    A new `--keep-compression` option has been added to both `barman-wal-restore` and
    `get-wal`. This option controls whether compressed WAL files should be decompressed
    on the Barman server before being fetched. When specified with `get-wal`, default
    decompression is skipped, and the output is the WAL file content in its original
    state. When specified with `barman-wal-restore`, the WAL file is fetched as-is and,
    if compressed, decompressed on the client side.
