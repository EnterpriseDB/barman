- summary: Add FIPS support to Barman
  description: |
    The `md5` hash algorithm is not FIPS compliant, so it is going to be replaced by
    `sha256`. `sha256` is FIPS compliant, vastly used and is considered secure for most
    practical purposes.
    Up until this release, Barman's WAL archive client used `hashlib.md5` to generate
    checksums for tar files before they are sent to the Barman server. Here, a tar file is
    a file format used for bundling multiple files together with a `MD5SUMS` file that lists
    the checksums and their corresponding paths.
    In this release, the `md5` hashing algorithm is replaced by `sha256` as the default.
    As a result, checksums for the tar files will be calculated using `sha256`, and the
    `MD5SUMS` file will be named `SHA256SUMS`. Barman still has the ability to use the
    non default `md5` algorithm and the `MD5SUMS` file from the client if there is a use
    case for it. The user just needs to add the `--md5` flag to the `barman-wal-archive`
    `archive_command`.
