- summary: Cloud connectivity checks are now only performed with the -t/--test flag.
  description: |
    Previously, Barman used to always test cloud connectivity and bucket existence
    for most of the commands, raising errors if connectivity failed or if the bucket
    did not exist.

    Both checks are now executed only when the -t/--test flag is specified.
    Buckets are no longer created automatically â€” Barman assumes the target bucket
    already exists, making it the user's responsibility to provision the bucket in
    advance.
