- summary: Reorganize fields in barman diagnose JSON
  description: |
    In the barman diagnose JSON, some fields appeared under the server's "config"
    section even though they were not actual configuration fields.

    The fields "barman_lock_directory", "lock_directory_cleanup", and
    "config_changes_queue" were relocated under the "global" key, since they represent
    global configurations. The "name" field was removed since the server name is already
    used as the key. Additionally, "msg_list" is now stored under the server's name key.
