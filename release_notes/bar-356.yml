- summary: Fix missing options for `barman keep`
  description: |
    The error message that the Barman CLI emitted when running `barman keep`
    without any options suggested there were shortcut aliases for status and
    release. These aliases, -s and -r, do not exist, so the error message was
    misleading.
    This fixes the issue by including these short options in the Barman CLI,
    aligning it with other tools like `barman-cloud-backup-keep`, where these
    shortcuts already exist.
