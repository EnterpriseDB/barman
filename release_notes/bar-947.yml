- summary: Improve barman-cloud delete workaround to inspect error message content
  description: |
    Some S3-compatible storages return an "InvalidRequest" error instead of
    "MissingContentMD5" during delete operations. Since we cannot rely on the error code
    alone, this updates the logic to also inspect the error message text to detect
    MissingContentMD5-like issues and apply the appropriate fallback.
