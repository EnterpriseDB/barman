- summary: The `barman show-backup`` command now displays the backup compression method
  description: |
    The output of the `barman show-backup` command has been enhanced to include a new
    `Backup Compression` field. If a backup was taken with compression enabled, this
    field will now display the compression algorithm that was used (e.g., `zstd`). This
    makes it easier to quickly verify the compression status of a backup.
