- summary: Fix passive node not syncing
  description: |
    In Barman 3.16 the "name" field was removed from the "config" key of
    the `barman diagnose` command. Turns out the same "config" data is also
    used when syncing a passive node, and the absence of the "name" field
    caused the sync to fail.

    This change adds back the "name" field to the "config" key, fixing
    the sync of passive nodes.

    Reported in GitHub issue #1125.
