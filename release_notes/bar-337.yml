- summary: Update documentation and user-facing features for Barman's recovery process.
  description: |
    Barman docs and the tool itself used to use the terms "recover"/"recovery" both for
    referencing:

    * The Postgres recovery process;
    * The process of restoring a backup and preparing it for recovery.

    Both the code and documentation have been revised to accurately reflect the usage of
    the the terms "restore" and "recover"/"recovery".

    Also, the `barman recover` command was renamed to `barman restore`. The old name is
    still kept as an alias for backward compatibility.
