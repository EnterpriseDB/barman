    Ransomware protection - Add AWS Snapshot Lock Support
  description: |
    Barman now supports AWS EBS Snapshot Lock, a new integrated feature to prevent
    accidental or malicious deletions of Amazon EBS snapshots. When a snapshot is
    locked, it can't be deleted by any user, but remains fully accessible for use. This
    feature enables you to store snapshots in WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) format for a
    specified duration, helping to meet regulatory requirements by keeping the data
    secure and tamper-proof until the lock expires.

    Special thanks to Rui Marinho, our community contributor that started this feature.
