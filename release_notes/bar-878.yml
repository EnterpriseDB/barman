- summary: Deprecate `pygzip` and `pybzip2` compression options
  description: |
    The `pygzip` and `pybzip2` compression options are now deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Users should migrate to the `gzip` and `bzip2` options,
    which now use Python's internal libraries.

    This change was made to improve performance and code consistency. Previously, the
    `gzip` and `bzip2` options relied on external subprocesses, while their `py`
    counterparts used native Python libraries. The core compression logic for `gzip` and
    `bzip2` has been updated to also use Python's built-in libraries, making the
    `pygzip` and `pybzip2` options redundant.
