- summary: Lighten standby checks related to conninfo and primary_conninfo
  description: |
    When backing up a standby server, Barman performs some checks to assert
    that `conninfo` is really pointing to a standby (in recovery mode) and
    that `primary_conninfo` is pointing to a primary (not in recovery).

    The problem, as reported in the issues #704 and #744, is that when a
    failover occurs, the `conninfo` will now be pointing to a primary
    instead and the checks will start failing, requiring the user to change
    Barman configs manually whenever a failover occurs.

    This fix solved the issue by making such checks non-critical, which
    means they will still fail but Barman will keep operating regardless.
    Essentially, Barman will ignore `primary_conninfo` if `conninfo` does
    not point to a standby. Warnings about this misconfiguration will also
    be emited whenever running any Barman command so the user can be aware.
