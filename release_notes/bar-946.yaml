- summary: Add S3 Object Lock support for the deletion of backups in barman-cloud
  description: |
    `barman-cloud-backup-delete` now supports checking for Object Lock before
    deleting backups in AWS S3. This feature helps prevent deletion of objects
    protected by compliance or governance retention policies.

    A new `--check-object-lock` option has been added, which enables Object Lock
    verification before deletion. When enabled, the deletion operation for all objects of
    a base backup will be aborted if any of those objects is locked. For performance
    reasons, lock checks are only performed for base backup files, since once the
    base backup is removed, the corresponding WAL files are no longer useful.

    Note that this feature adds overhead to the delete operation, as it requires an
    additional API call for each object being deleted. This feature is only available
    for AWS S3-compatible object stores and requires the appropriate permissions
    to function correctly.
