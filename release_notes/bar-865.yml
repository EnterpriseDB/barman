- summary: Fix parallelism (--parallel option) in barman-wal-restore
  description: |
    There has been a regression in `barman-wal-restore` when introducing the
    `--keep-compression` option in Barman 3.12.0, which made the `--parallel` option
    not invoke processes as expected. This issue has now been fixed.
