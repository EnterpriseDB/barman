- summary: Enable query, fetch, and selective operations on inactive/disabled servers
  description: |
    Multiple Barman commands now work with inactive and disabled servers based
    on their safety profile:

    **Query commands**:
    - `list-backups`: view backups from inactive/disabled servers
    - `status`: check status of inactive/disabled servers
    - `show-backup`: display backup details from inactive/disabled servers
    - `list-files`: list files from backups on inactive/disabled servers
    - `verify-backup`: verify backups on inactive/disabled servers

    **Fetch commands**:
    - `restore`: restore backups from inactive servers
    - `get-wal`: retrieve WAL files from inactive servers

    **Modification commands**:
    - `delete`: delete backups from inactive servers
    - `config-switch`: switch configuration models for inactive/disabled servers

    This change improves operational flexibility by allowing users to query
    backup information and perform restore operations even when servers are
    manually disabled (inactive) or have configuration issues (disabled). The
    different behavior for disabled servers provides safety against operations
    on servers with potential configuration conflicts or path issues.
