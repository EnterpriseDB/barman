- summary: Add `combine-mode` option to `barman restore` command
  description: |
    Added a `--combine-mode` option to the `barman restore` command, which can be used
    to specify a copy mode for `pg_combinebackup` when combining incremental backups
    during a restore. Available modes are `copy`, `link`, `clone` and `copy-file-range`
        which are equivalent to the `pg_combinebackup` options `--copy`, `--link`,
    `--clone`, and `--copy-file-range`, respectively. An equivalent `combine_mode`
    configuration option can be specified in the configuration file.

    This feature allows for greater optimization of the restore process
    based on the underlying filesystem capabilities.
