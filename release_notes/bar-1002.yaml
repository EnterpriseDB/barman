- summary: Fix delta restore not working
  description: |
    The delta restore feature was not functioning correctly due to an oversight
    where Barman was removing the destination directory before performing a restore.
    The problem was fixed by avoiding the removal of the destination directory on
    certain operations.
    Reported in GitHub issue #1139.
