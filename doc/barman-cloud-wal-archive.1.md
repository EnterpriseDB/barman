# NAME

barman-cloud-wal-archive - Archive PostgreSQL WAL files in the Cloud using `archive_command`


# SYNOPSIS

barman-cloud-wal-archive [*OPTIONS*] *DESTINATION_URL* *SERVER_NAME* *WAL_PATH*


# DESCRIPTION

This script can be used in the `archive_command` of a PostgreSQL
server to ship WAL files to the Cloud. Currently AWS S3 and Azure Blob
Storage are supported.

Note: If you are running python 2 or older unsupported versions of
python 3 then avoid the compression options `--gzip` or `--bzip2` as
barman-cloud-wal-restore is unable to restore gzip-compressed WALs
on python < 3.2 or bzip2-compressed WALs on python < 3.3.

This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery
of PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.


# POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

DESTINATION_URL
:    URL of the cloud destination, such as a bucket in AWS S3.
     For example: `s3://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/folder` (where `BUCKET_NAME`
     is the bucket you have created in AWS).


SERVER_NAME
:    the name of the server as configured in Barman.

WAL_PATH
:    the value of the '%p' keyword (according to 'archive_command').

-v, --verbose
:    increase output verbosity (e.g., -vv is more than -v)

-q, --quiet
:    decrease output verbosity (e.g., -qq is less than -q)

-t, --test
:    test connectivity to the cloud destination and exit

-z, --gzip
:    gzip-compress the WAL while uploading to the cloud
     (should not be used with python < 3.2)

-j, --bzip2
:    bzip2-compress the WAL while uploading to the cloud
     (should not be used with python < 3.3)

--cloud-provider {aws-s3,azure-blob-storage}
:    the cloud provider to which the backup should be uploaded

-P, --profile
:    profile name (e.g. INI section in AWS credentials file)

--endpoint-url
