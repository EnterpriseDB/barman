.SH NAME
.PP
barman\-cloud\-backup\-delete \- Delete backups stored in the Cloud
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
barman\-cloud\-backup\-delete [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[]] \f[I]SOURCE_URL\f[]
\f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script can be used to delete backups previously made with the
\f[C]barman\-cloud\-backup\f[] command.
Currently AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage are
supported.
.PP
The target backups can be specified either using the backup ID (as
returned by barman\-cloud\-backup\-list) or by retention policy.
Retention policies are the same as those for Barman server and work as
described in the Barman manual: all backups not required to meet the
specified policy will be deleted.
.PP
When a backup is successfully deleted any unused WALs associated with
that backup are removed.
WALs are only considered unused if:
.IP "1." 3
There are no older backups than the deleted backup \f[I]or\f[] all older
backups are archival backups.
.IP "2." 3
The WALs pre\-date the begin_wal value of the oldest remaining backup.
.IP "3." 3
The WALs are not required by any archival backups present in cloud
storage.
.PP
Note: The deletion of each backup involves three separate delete
requests to the cloud provider (once for the backup files, once for the
backup.info file and once for any associated WALs).
If you have a significant number of backups accumulated in cloud storage
then deleting by retention policy could result in a large number of
delete requests.
.PP
This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery of
PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
