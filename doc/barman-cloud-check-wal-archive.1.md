# NAME

barman-cloud-check-wal-archive - Check a WAL archive destination for a new PostgreSQL cluster


# SYNOPSIS

barman-cloud-check-wal-archive [*OPTIONS*] *SOURCE_URL* *SERVER_NAME*


# DESCRIPTION

Check that the WAL archive destination for *SERVER_NAME* is safe to use
for a new PostgreSQL cluster. With no optional args (the default) this
check will pass if the WAL archive is empty and fail otherwise.

This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery
of PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.


# POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

SOURCE_URL
:    URL of the cloud source, such as a bucket in AWS S3.
     For example: `s3://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/folder` (where `BUCKET_NAME`
     is the bucket you have created in AWS).

SERVER_NAME
:    the name of the server as configured in Barman.

# OPTIONS

-h, --help
:    show a help message and exit

-V, --version
:    show program's version number and exit

-v, --verbose
:    increase output verbosity (e.g., -vv is more than -v)

-q, --quiet
:    decrease output verbosity (e.g., -qq is less than -q)

-t, --test
:    test connectivity to the cloud destination and exit

--timeline
:    A positive integer specifying the earliest timeline for which
     associated WALs should cause the check to fail.
     The check will pass if all WAL content in the archive relates
     to earlier timelines. If any WAL files are on this timeline or
     greater then the check will fail.

--cloud-provider {aws-s3,azure-blob-storage}
:    the cloud provider to which the backup should be uploaded

-P, --profile
:    profile name (e.g. INI section in AWS credentials file)

--endpoint-url
:    override the default S3 URL construction mechanism by specifying an endpoint.
