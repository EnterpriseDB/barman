# NAME

barman-wal-archive - `archive_command` based on Barman's put-wal


# SYNOPSIS

barman-wal-archive [*OPTIONS*] *BARMAN_HOST* *SERVER_NAME* *WAL_PATH*


# DESCRIPTION

This script can be used in the `archive_command` of a PostgreSQL
server to ship WAL files to a Barman host using the 'put-wal' command
(introduced in Barman 2.6).
An SSH connection will be opened to the Barman host.
`barman-wal-archive` allows the integration of Barman in PostgreSQL
clusters for better business continuity results.

This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery
of PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
