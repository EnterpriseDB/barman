.SH NAME
.PP
barman-cloud-wal-archive - Archive PostgreSQL WAL files in the Cloud
using \f[C]archive_command\f[R]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
barman-cloud-wal-archive [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] \f[I]DESTINATION_URL\f[R]
\f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[R] \f[I]WAL_PATH\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script can be used in the \f[C]archive_command\f[R] of a PostgreSQL
server to ship WAL files to the Cloud.
Currently AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage are supported.
.PP
Note: If you are running python 2 or older unsupported versions of
python 3 then avoid the compression options \f[C]--gzip\f[R] or
\f[C]--bzip2\f[R] as barman-cloud-wal-restore is unable to restore
gzip-compressed WALs on python < 3.2 or bzip2-compressed WALs on python
< 3.3.
.PP
This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery of
PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
