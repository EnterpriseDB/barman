.SH NAME
.PP
barman\-cloud\-wal\-archive \- Archive PostgreSQL WAL files in the Cloud
using \f[C]archive_command\f[]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
barman\-cloud\-wal\-archive [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[]] \f[I]DESTINATION_URL\f[]
\f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[] \f[I]WAL_PATH\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script can be used in the \f[C]archive_command\f[] of a PostgreSQL
server to ship WAL files to the Cloud.
Currently AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage are supported.
.PP
Note: If you are running python 2 or older unsupported versions of
python 3 then avoid the compression options \f[C]\-\-gzip\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-bzip2\f[] as barman\-cloud\-wal\-restore is unable to restore
gzip\-compressed WALs on python < 3.2 or bzip2\-compressed WALs on
python < 3.3.
.PP
This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery of
PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
