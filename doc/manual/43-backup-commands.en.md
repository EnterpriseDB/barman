# Backup commands

Backup commands are those that works directly on backups already existing in
Barman's backup catalog.

> **NOTE:**
> Remember a backup ID can be retrieved with `barman list-backups
> <server_name>`

## Backup ID shortcuts

Barman allows you to use special keywords to identify a specific backup:

* `last/latest`: identifies the newest backup in the catalog
* `first/oldest`: identifies the oldest backup in the catalog
* `last-failed`: identifies the newest failed backup in the catalog

Using those keywords with Barman commands allows you to execute actions
without knowing the exact ID of a backup for a server.
For example we can issue:

``` bash
barman delete <server_name> oldest
```

to remove the oldest backup available in the catalog and reclaim disk space.

Additionally, if backup was taken with the `--name <friendly_name>` option,
you can use the friendly name in place of the backup ID to refer to that
specific backup.

## `check-backup`

Starting with version 2.5, you can check that all required WAL files
for the consistency of a full backup have been correctly archived by
`barman` with the `check-backup` command:

``` bash
barman check-backup <server_name> <backup_id>
```

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This command is automatically invoked by `cron` and at the end of a
> `backup` operation. This means that, under normal circumstances,
> you should never need to execute it.

In case one or more WAL files from the start to the end of the backup
have not been archived yet, `barman` will label the backup as
`WAITING_FOR_WALS`. The `cron` command will continue to check that
missing WAL files are archived, then label the backup as `DONE`.

In case the first required WAL file is missing at the end of the
backup, such backup will be marked as `FAILED`. It is therefore
important that you verify that WAL archiving (whether via streaming
or `archive_command`) is properly working before executing a backup
operation - especially when backing up from a standby server.


## `delete`

You can delete a given backup with:

``` bash
barman delete <server_name> <backup_id>
```

The `delete` command accepts any [shortcut](#backup-id-shortcuts) to identify backups.

## `keep`

If you have a backup which you wish to keep beyond the retention policy of
the server then you can make it an archival backup with:

```bash
barman keep <server_name> <backup_id> [--target TARGET, --status, --release]
```

Possible values for `TARGET` are:

- `full`: The backup can always be used to recover to the latest point in
  time. To achieve this, Barman will retain all WALs needed to ensure
  consistency of the backup and all subsequent WALs.
- `standalone`: The backup can only be used to recover the server to its
  state at the time the backup was taken. Barman will only retain the WALs
  needed to ensure consistency of the backup.

If the `--status` option is provided then Barman will report the archival
status of the backup. This will either be the recovery target of `full` or
`standalone` for archival backups or `nokeep` for backups which have not
been flagged as archival.

If the `--release` option is provided then Barman will release the keep
flag from this backup. This will remove its archival status and make it
available for deletion, either directly or by retention policy.

Once a backup has been flagged as an archival backup, the behaviour of
Barman will change as follows:

- Attempts to delete that backup by ID using `barman delete` will fail.
- Retention policies will never consider that backup as `OBSOLETE` and
  therefore `barman cron` will never delete that backup.
- The WALs required by that backup will be retained forever. If the
  specified recovery target is `full` then *all* subsequent WALs will also
  be retained.

This can be reverted by removing the keep flag with
`barman keep <server_name> <backup_id> --release`.

> **WARNING:** Once a `standalone` archival backup is not required by the
> retention policy of a server `barman cron` will remove the WALs between
> that backup and the begin_wal value of the next most recent backup. This
> means that while it is safe to change the target from `full` to `standalone`,
> it is *not* safe to change the target from `standalone` to `full` because
> there is no guarantee the necessary WALs for a recovery to the latest point
> in time will still be available.

## `list-files`

You can list the files (base backup and required WAL files) for a
given backup with:

``` bash
barman list-files [--target TARGET_TYPE] <server_name> <backup_id>
```

With the `--target TARGET_TYPE` option, it is possible to choose the
content of the list for a given backup.

Possible values for `TARGET_TYPE` are:

- `data`: lists the data files
- `standalone`: lists the base backup files, including required WAL
  files
- `wal`: lists all WAL files from the beginning of the base backup to
  the start of the following one (or until the end of the log)
- `full`: same as `data` + `wal`

The default value for `TARGET_TYPE` is `standalone`.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The `list-files` command facilitates interaction with external
> tools, and can therefore be extremely useful to integrate
> Barman into your archiving procedures.

## `recover`

The `recover` command is used to recover a whole server after
a backup is executed using the `backup` command.

This is achieved issuing a command like the following:

```bash
barman@backup$ barman recover <server_name> <backup_id> /path/to/recover/dir
```

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Do not issue a `recover` command using a target data directory where
> a PostgreSQL instance is running. In that case, remember to stop it
> before issuing the recovery. This applies also to tablespace directories.

At the end of the execution of the recovery, the selected backup is recovered
locally and the destination path contains a data directory ready to be used
to start a PostgreSQL instance.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Running this command as user `barman`, it will become the database superuser.

The specific ID of a backup can be retrieved using the [list-backups](#list-backups)
command.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Barman does not currently keep track of symbolic links inside PGDATA
> (except for tablespaces inside pg_tblspc). We encourage
> system administrators to keep track of symbolic links and to add them
> to the disaster recovery plans/procedures in case they need to be restored
> in their original location.

The recovery command has several options that modify the command behavior.

### Remote recovery

Add the `--remote-ssh-command <COMMAND>` option to the invocation
of the recovery command. Doing this will allow Barman to execute
the copy on a remote server, using the provided command to connect
to the remote host.

> **NOTE:**
> It is advisable to use the `postgres` user to perform
> the recovery on the remote host.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Do not issue a `recover` command using a target data directory where
> a PostgreSQL instance is running. In that case, remember to stop it
> before issuing the recovery. This applies also to tablespace directories.

Known limitations of the remote recovery are:

* Barman requires at least 4GB of free space in the system temporary directory
  unless the [`get-wal`](#get-wal) command is specified
  in the `recovery_option` parameter in the Barman configuration.
* The SSH connection between Barman and the remote host **must** use the
  public key exchange authentication method
* The remote user **must** be able to create the directory structure
  of the backup in the destination directory.
* There must be enough free space on the remote server
  to contain the base backup and the WAL files needed for recovery.

### Tablespace remapping

Barman is able to automatically remap one or more tablespaces using
the recover command with the --tablespace option.
The option accepts a pair of values as arguments using the
`NAME:DIRECTORY` format:

* `NAME` is the identifier of the tablespace
* `DIRECTORY` is the new destination path for the tablespace

If the destination directory does not exists,
Barman will try to create it (assuming you have the required permissions).

### Point in time recovery

Barman wraps PostgreSQL's Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR),
allowing you to specify a recovery target, either as a timestamp,
as a restore label, or as a transaction ID.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The earliest PITR for a given backup is the end of the base
> backup itself. If you want to recover at any point in time
> between the start and the end of a backup, you must use
> the previous backup. From Barman 2.3 you can exit recovery
> when consistency is reached by using `--target-immediate` option.

The recovery target can be specified using one of
the following mutually exclusive options:

* `--target-time TARGET_TIME`: to specify a timestamp
* `--target-xid TARGET_XID`: to specify a transaction ID
* `--target-lsn TARGET_LSN`: to specify a Log Sequence Number (LSN) -
  requires PostgreSQL 10 or higher
* `--target-name TARGET_NAME`: to specify a named restore point
  previously created with the pg_create_restore_point(name)
  function
* `--target-immediate`: recovery ends when a consistent state is reached
                 (that is the end of the base backup process)

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Recovery target via _time_, _XID_ and LSN **must be** subsequent to the
> end of the backup. If you want to recover to a point in time between
> the start and the end of a backup, you must recover from the
> previous backup in the catalogue.

You can use the `--exclusive` option to specify whether to stop immediately
before or immediately after the recovery target.

Barman allows you to specify a target timeline for recovery
using the `--target-tli` option. This can be set to a numeric timeline ID
or one of the special values `latest` (to recover to the most recent timeline
in the WAL archive) and `current` (to recover to the timeline which was current
when the backup was taken). If this option is omitted then PostgreSQL versions 12
and above will recover to the `latest` timeline and PostgreSQL versions below 12
will recover to the `current` timeline. You can find more details about timelines
in the PostgreSQL documentation as mentioned in the _"Before you start"_ section.

Barman 2.4 introduces support for `--target-action` option, accepting
the following values:

* `shutdown`: once recovery target is reached, PostgreSQL is shut down
* `pause`: once recovery target is reached, PostgreSQL is started in pause
   state, allowing users to inspect the instance
* `promote`: once recovery target is reached, PostgreSQL will exit recovery
   and is promoted as a master

> **IMPORTANT:**
> By default, no target action is defined (for back compatibility).
> The `--target-action` option requires a Point In Time Recovery target
> to be specified.


For more detailed information on the above settings, please consult
the [PostgreSQL documentation on recovery target settings][target].

Barman 2.4 also adds the `--standby-mode` option for the `recover`
command which, if specified, properly configures the recovered instance
as a standby by creating a `standby.signal` file (from PostgreSQL 12)
or by adding `standby_mode = on` to the generated recovery configuration.
Further information on _standby mode_ is available in the PostgreSQL documentation.

### Fetching WALs from the Barman server

The `barman recover` command can optionally configure PostgreSQL to fetch
WALs from Barman during recovery. This is enabled by setting the
`recovery_options` global/server configuration option to `'get-wal'` as
described in the [get-wal section](#get-wal). If `recovery_options` is not
set or is empty then Barman will instead copy the WALs required for recovery
while executing the `barman recover` command.

The `--get-wal` and `--no-get-wal` options can be used to override the
behaviour defined by `recovery_options`. Use `--get-wal` with `barman recover`
to enable the fetching of WALs from the Barman server, alternatively use
`--no-get-wal` to disable it.

### Recovering compressed backups

If a backup has been compressed using the `backup_compression` option
then `barman recover` is able to uncompress the backup on recovery. This
is a multi-step process:

1. The compressed backup files are copied to a staging directory on the
   local or remote server using Rsync.
2. The compressed files are uncompressed to the target directory.
3. Config files which need special handling by Barman are copied from the
   recovery destination, analysed or edited as required, and copied back to
   the recovery destination using Rsync.
4. The staging directory for the backup is removed.

Because barman does not know anything about the environment in which it
will be deployed it relies on the `recovery_staging_path` option in order
to choose a suitable location for the staging directory.

If you are using the `backup_compression` option you *must* therefore
either set `recovery_staging_path` in the global/server config *or* use
the `--recovery-staging-path` option with the `barman recover` command. If
you do neither of these things and attempt to recover a compressed backup
then Barman will fail rather than try to guess a suitable location.

## `show-backup`

You can retrieve all the available information for a particular backup of
a given server with:

``` bash
barman show-backup <server_name> <backup_id>
```

The `show-backup` command accepts any [shortcut](#backup-id-shortcuts) to identify backups.
