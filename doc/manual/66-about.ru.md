# The Barman project

## Support and sponsor opportunities

Barman is free software, written and maintained by 2ndQuadrant. If you
require support on using Barman, or if you need new features, please
get in touch with 2ndQuadrant. You can sponsor the development of new
features of Barman and PostgreSQL which will be made publicly
available as open source.

## Contributing to Barman

2ndQuadrant has a team of software engineers, architects, database
administrators, system administrators, QA engineers, developers and
managers that dedicate their time and expertise to improve Barman's code.
We adopt lean and agile methodologies for software development, and
we believe in the _devops_ culture that allowed us to implement rigorous
testing procedures through cross-functional collaboration.
Every Barman commit is the contribution of multiple individuals, at different
stages of the production pipeline.

Even though this is our preferred way of developing Barman, we gladly
accept patches from external developers, as long as:

- user documentation (tutorial and man pages) is provided.
- source code is properly documented and contains relevant comments.
- code supplied is covered by unit tests.
- no unrelated feature is compromised or broken.
- source code is rebased on the current master branch.
- commits and pull requests are limited to a single feature (multi-feature
patches are hard to test and review).
- changes to the user interface are discussed beforehand with 2ndQuadrant.

We also require that any contributions provide a copyright assignment
and a disclaimer of any work-for-hire ownership claims from the employer
of the developer.

You can use Github's pull requests system for this purpose.
