# Server commands

As we said in the previous section, server commands work directly on
a PostgreSQL server or on its area in Barman, and are useful to check
its status, perform maintainance operations, take backups, and
manage the WAL archive.

## `archive-wal`

The `archive-wal` command execute maintainance operations on WAL files
for a given server. This operations include processing of the WAL
files received from the streaming connection or from the
`archive_command` or both.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The `archive-wal` command, even if it can be directly invoked, is
> designed to be started from the `cron` general command.

## `backup`

The `backup` command takes a full backup (_base backup_) of a given
server. It has several options that let you override the corresponding
configuration parameter for the new backup. For more information,
consult the manual page.

You can perform a full backup for a given server with:

``` bash
barman backup <server_name>
```

> **TIP:**
> You can use `barman backup all` to sequentially backup all your
> configured servers.


## `check`

You can check the connection to a given server and the
configuration coherence with the `check` command:

``` bash
barman check <server_name>
```

> **TIP:**
> You can use `barman check all` to check all your configured servers.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The `check` command is probably the most critical feature that
> Barman implements. We recommend to integrate it with your alerting
> and monitoring infrastructure. The `--nagios` option allows you
> to easily create a plugin for Nagios/Icinga.

## `get-wal`

Barman allows users to request any _xlog_ file from its WAL archive
through the `get-wal` command:

``` bash
barman get-wal [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY][-j|-x] <server_name> <wal_id>
```

If the requested WAL file is found in the server archive, the
uncompressed content will be returned to `STDOUT`, unless otherwise
specified.

The following options are available for the `get-wal` command:

- `-o` allows users to specify a destination directory where Barman
  will deposit the requested WAL file
- `-j` will compress the output using `bzip2` algorithm
- `-x` will compress the output using `gzip` algorithm
- `-p SIZE` peeks from the archive up to WAL files, starting from
  the requested file

It is possible to use `get-wal` during a recovery operation,
transforming the Barman server into a _WAL hub_ for your servers. This
can be automatically achieved by adding the `get-wal` value to the
`recovery_options` global/server configuration option:

``` ini
recovery_options = 'get-wal'
```

`recovery_options` is a global/server option that accepts a list of
comma separated values. If the keyword `get-wal` is present during a
recovery operation, Barman will prepare the recovery configuration by
setting the `restore_command` so that `barman get-wal` is used to
fetch the required WAL files.
Similarly, one can use the `--get-wal` option for the `recover` command
at run-time.

This is an example of a `restore_command` for a local recovery:

``` ini
restore_command = 'sudo -u barman barman get-wal SERVER %f > %p'
```

Please note that the `get-wal` command should always be invoked as
`barman` user, and that it requires the correct permission to
read the WAL files from the catalog. This is the reason why we are
using `sudo -u barman` in the example.

Setting `recovery_options` to `get-wal` for a remote recovery will instead
generate a `restore_command` using the `barman-wal-restore` script.
`barman-wal-restore` is a more resilient shell script which manages SSH
connection errors.

This script has many useful options such as the automatic compression and
decompression of the WAL files and the *peek* feature, which allows you
to retrieve the next WAL files while PostgreSQL is applying one of them. It is
an excellent way to optimise the bandwidth usage between PostgreSQL and
Barman.

`barman-wal-restore` is available in the `barman-cli` package.

This is an example of a `restore_command` for a remote recovery:

``` ini
restore_command = 'barman-wal-restore -U barman backup SERVER %f %p'
```

Since it uses SSH to communicate with the Barman server, SSH key authentication
is required for the `postgres` user to login as `barman` on the backup server.

You can check that `barman-wal-restore` can connect to the Barman server,
and that the required PostgreSQL server is configured in Barman to send
WAL files with the following command:

``` bash
barman-wal-restore --test backup pg DUMMY DUMMY
```

Where `backup` is the host where Barman is installed, `pg` is the name
of the PostgreSQL server as configured in Barman and DUMMY is a placeholder
(`barman-wal-restore` requires two argument for the WAL file name
and destination directory, which are ignored).
For more information on the `barman-wal-restore` command,
type `man barman-wal-restore` on the PostgreSQL server.

## `list-backup`

You can list the catalog of available backups for a given server
with:

``` bash
barman list-backup <server_name>
```

> **TIP:** You can request a full list of the backups of all servers
> using `all` as the server name.

To have a machine-readable output you can use the `--minimal` option.

## `rebuild-xlogdb`

At any time, you can regenerate the content of the WAL archive for a
specific server (or every server, using the `all` shortcut). The WAL
archive is contained in the `xlog.db` file and every server managed by
Barman has its own copy.

The `xlog.db` file can be rebuilt with the `rebuild-xlogdb`
command. This will scan all the archived WAL files and regenerate the
metadata for the archive.

For example:

``` bash
barman rebuild-xlogdb <server_name>
```

## `receive-wal`

This command manages the `receive-wal` process, which uses the
streaming protocol to receive WAL files from the PostgreSQL streaming
connection.

### receive-wal process management

If the command is run without options, a `receive-wal` process will
be started. This command is based on the `pg_receivewal` PostgreSQL
command.

``` bash
barman receive-wal <server_name>
```

> **NOTE:**
> The `receive-wal` command is a foreground process.

If the command is run with the `--stop` option, the currently running
`receive-wal` process will be stopped.

The `receive-wal` process uses a status file to track last written
record of the transaction log. When the status file needs to be
cleaned, the `--reset` option can be used.

> **IMPORTANT:** If you are not using replication slots, you rely
> on the value of `wal_keep_segments`. Be aware that under high peeks
> of workload on the database, the `receive-wal` process
> might fall behind and go out of sync. As a precautionary measure,
> Barman currently requires that users manually execute the command with the
> `--reset` option, to avoid making wrong assumptions.

### Replication slot management

The `receive-wal` process is also useful to create or drop the
replication slot needed by Barman for its WAL archiving procedure.

With the `--create-slot` option, the replication slot named after the
`slot_name` configuration option will be created on the PostgreSQL
server.

With the `--drop-slot`, the previous replication slot will be deleted.

## `replication-status`

The `replication-status` command reports the status of any streaming
client currently attached to the PostgreSQL server, including the
`receive-wal` process of your Barman server (if configured).

You can execute the command as follows:

``` bash
barman replication-status <server_name>
```

> **TIP:** You can request a full status report of the replica
> for all your servers using `all` as the server name.

To have a machine-readable output you can use the `--minimal` option.

## `show-server`

You can show the configuration parameters for a given server with:

``` bash
barman show-server <server_name>
```

> **TIP:** you can request a full configuration report using `all` as
> the server name.


## `status`

The `status` command shows live information and status of a PostgreSQL
server or of all servers if you use `all` as server name.

``` bash
barman status <server_name>
```

## `switch-wal`

This command makes the PostgreSQL server switch to another transaction
log file (WAL), allowing the current log file to be closed, received and then
archived.

``` bash
barman switch-wal <server_name>
```

If there has been no transaction activity since the last transaction
log file switch, the switch needs to be forced using the
`--force` option.

The `--archive` option requests Barman to trigger WAL archiving after
the xlog switch. By default, a 30 seconds timeout is enforced (this
can be changed with `--archive-timeout`). If no WAL file is received,
an error is returned.

> **NOTE:** In Barman 2.1 and 2.2 this command was called `switch-xlog`.
> It has been renamed for naming consistency with PostgreSQL 10 and higher.
