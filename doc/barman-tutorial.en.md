% February 1, 2016 (v1.6.0b1)

**Barman** (backup and recovery manager) is an administration tool for
disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers written in Python. Barman can
perform remote backups of multiple servers in business critical
environments, and helps DBAs during the recovery phase.

Barman's most wanted features include: backup catalogues, incremental
backup, retention policies, remote recovery, archiving and compression
of WAL files and of backups. Barman is written and maintained by
PostgreSQL professionals 2ndQuadrant.

# Introduction

In a perfect world, there would be no need for a backup. However it is
important, especially in business environments, to be prepared for
when the _"unexpected"_ happens. In a database scenario, the
unexpected could take any of the following forms:

- data corruption;
- system failure, including hardware failure;
- human error;
- natural disaster.

In such cases, any ICT manager or DBA should be able to repair the
incident and recover the database in the shortest possible time. We
normally refer to this discipline as **Disaster recovery**.

This guide assumes that you are familiar with theoretical disaster
recovery concepts, and you have a grasp of PostgreSQL fundamentals in
terms of physical backup and disaster recovery. If not, we encourage
you to read the PostgreSQL documentation or any of the recommended
books on PostgreSQL.

Professional training on this topic is another effective way of
learning these concepts. At any time of the year you can find many
courses available all over the world, delivered by PostgreSQL
companies such as 2ndQuadrant.

For now, you should be aware that any PostgreSQL physical/binary
backup (not to be confused with the logical backups produced by the
`pg_dump` utility) is composed of:

- a base backup;
- one or more WAL files (usually collected through continuous
  archiving).

PostgreSQL offers the core primitives that allow DBAs to setup a
really robust Disaster Recovery environment. However, it becomes
complicated to manage multiple backups, from one or more PostgreSQL
servers. Restoring a given backup is another task that any PostgreSQL
DBA would love to see more automated and user friendly.

With these goals in mind, 2ndQuadrant started the development of
Barman for PostgreSQL. Barman is an acronym for "Backup and Recovery
Manager". Currently Barman works only on Linux and Unix operating
systems.

# Before you start

The first step is to decide the architecture of your backup. In a
simple scenario, you have one **PostgreSQL instance** (server) running
on a host. You want your data continuously backed up to another
server, called the **backup server**.

Barman allows you to launch PostgreSQL backups directly from the
backup server, using SSH connections. Furthermore, it allows you to
centralise your backups in case you have more than one PostgreSQL
server to manage.

During this guide, we will assume that:

- there is one PostgreSQL instance on a host (called `pg` for
  simplicity)
- there is one backup server on another host (called `backup`)
- communication via SSH between the two servers is enabled
- the PostgreSQL server can be reached from the backup server as the
  `postgres` operating system user (or another user with PostgreSQL
  database _superuser_ privileges, typically configured via ident
  authentication)

It is important to note that, for disaster recovery, these two servers
must not share any physical resource except for the network. You can
use Barman in geographical redundancy scenarios for better disaster
recovery outcomes.

## System requirements

- Linux/Unix
- Python 2.6 or 2.7
- Python modules:
    - argcomplete
    - argh >= 0.21.2
    - psycopg2
    - python-dateutil < 2.0 (since version 2.0 requires python3)
    - distribute (optional)
- PostgreSQL >= 8.3
- rsync >= 3.0.4

> **Important:**
> PostgreSQL's Point-In-Time-Recovery requires the same major version
> of the sourcePostgreSQL server to be installed on the backup server.

> **Important:**
> Users of RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Scientific Linux are
> required to install the
> [Extra Packages Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository] [1].

> **Note:**
> Version 1.2.3 of Barman has been refactored for Python 3 support.
> Please consider it as experimental now and report any bug through
> the ticketing system on SourceForge or mailing list.

# Installation

> **Important:**
> The recommended way to install Barman is by using the available
> packages for your GNU/Linux distribution.

## On RedHat/CentOS using RPM packages

Barman can be installed on RHEL7, RHEL6 and RHEL5 Linux systems using
RPM packages. It is required to install the Extra Packages Enterprise
Linux (EPEL) repository beforehand.

RPM packages for Barman are available via Yum through the
[PostgreSQL Global Development Group RPM repository] [2].
You need to follow the instructions for your distribution (RedHat,
CentOS, Fedora, etc.) and architecture as detailed at
[yum.postgresql.org] [2].

Then, as `root` simply type:

``` bash
yum install barman
```

2ndQuadrant also maintains RPM packages for Barman and distributes
them through [Sourceforge.net] [3].

## On Debian/Ubuntu using packages

Barman can be installed on Debian and Ubuntu Linux systems using
packages.

It is directly available in the official repository for Debian Sid
(unstable) and Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr).

However, the recommended method for installing Barman on Debian and
Ubuntu is through the [PostgreSQL Community APT repository] [4].
Instructions can be found in the [APT section of the PostgreSQL Wiki] [5].

> **Note:**
> Thanks to the direct involvement of Barman developers in the
> PostgreSQL Community APT repository project, you will have access to
> the most updated versions of Barman.

Installing Barman is as simple as typing, as `root` user:

``` bash
apt-get install barman
```

## From sources

> **WARNING:**
> Manual installation of Barman from sources should only be performed
> by expert GNU/Linux users. Installing Barman this way requires
> system administration activities such as dependencies management,
> `barman` user creation, configuration of the `barman.conf` file,
> cron setup for the `barman cron` command, log management, etc.

Create a system user called `barman` on the `backup` server.
As `barman` user, download the sources and uncompress them.

For a system-wide installation, type:

``` bash
barman@backup$ ./setup.py build
# run this command with root privileges or through sudo
barman@backup# ./setup.py install
```

For a local installation, type:

``` bash
barman@backup$ ./setup.py install --user
```

> **Important:**
> The `--user` option works only with `python-distribute`

`barman` will be installed in your user directory (make sure that your
`PATH` environment variable is set properly).

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

### SSH connection

Barman needs a bidirectional SSH connection between the `barman` user
on the `backup` server and the `postgres` user. SSH must be configured
such that there is no password prompt presented when connecting.

As the `barman` user on the `backup` server, generate an SSH key with
an empty password, and append the public key to the `authorized_keys`
file of the `postgres` user on the `pg` server.

The `barman` user on the `backup` server should then be able to
perform the following operation without typing a password:

``` bash
barman@backup$ ssh postgres@pg
```

The procedure must be repeated with sides swapped in order to allow
the `postgres` user on the `pg` server to connect to the `backup`
server as the `barman` user without typing a password:

``` bash
postgres@pg$ ssh barman@backup
```

For further information, refer to OpenSSH documentation.

### PostgreSQL connection

You need to make sure that the `backup` server allows connection to
the PostgreSQL server on `pg` as superuser (`postgres`).

You can choose your favourite client authentication method among those
offered by PostgreSQL. More information can be found in the
[PostgreSQL Documentation] [6].

``` bash
barman@backup$ psql -c 'SELECT version()' -U postgres -h pg
```

> **Note:**
> As of version 1.1.2, Barman honours the `application_name`
> connection option for PostgreSQL servers 9.0 or higher.

#### Streaming connection

As of version 1.6.0 Barman enables the connection to a PostgreSQL
server using its native [streaming replication protocol] [22].
In order to set up a streaming connection, you need to:

- Properly configure PostgreSQL to accept streaming replication
  connections from the Barman server. We encourage users to
  read the PostgreSQL documentation, in particular:

    - [Role attributes] [23]
    - [The pg_hba.conf file] [23]
    - [Setting up standby servers using streaming replication] [24]
- Set the `streaming_conninfo` parameter in the Barman server configuration
  accordingly.

  > **IMPORTANT**: Setting up streaming replication is not a task
  > that is strictly related to Barman configuration. Please refer
  > to PostgreSQL documentation, mailing lists, and books for this activity.

### Backup directory

Barman needs a main backup directory to store all the backups. Even
though you can define a separate folder for each server you want to
back up and for each type of resource (backup or WAL segments, for
instance), we suggest that you adhere to the default rules and stick
with the conventions that Barman chooses for you.

You will see that the configuration file (as explained below) defines
a `barman_home` variable, which is the directory where Barman will
store all your backups by default. We choose `/var/lib/barman` as home
directory for Barman:

``` bash
barman@backup$ sudo mkdir /var/lib/barman
barman@backup$ sudo chown barman:barman /var/lib/barman
```

> **Important:**
> We assume that you have enough space, and that you have already
> thought about redundancy and safety of your disks.

## Basic configuration

In the `docs` directory you will find a minimal configuration file.
Use it as a template, and copy it to `/etc/barman.conf`, or to
`~/.barman.conf`. In general, the former applies to all the users on
the `backup` server, while the latter applies only to the `barman`
user; for the purpose of this tutorial there is no difference in using
one or the other.

From version 1.2.1, you can use `/etc/barman/barman.conf` as default
system configuration file.

The configuration file follows the standard INI format, and is split
in:

- a section for general configuration (identified by the `barman`
  label)
- a section for each PostgreSQL server to be backed up (identified by
  the server label, e.g. `main` or `pg`)[^RESERVED_SECTIONS]

[^RESERVED_SECTIONS]:
  `all` and `barman` are reserved words and cannot be used as server
  labels.

### Global/server options

Every option in the configuration file has a _scope_:

- global
- server
- global/server

Global options can be present in the _general section_ (identified by
`barman`). Server options can only be specified in a _server section_.

Some options can be defined at global level and overridden at server
level, allowing users to specify a generic behaviour and refine it for
one or more servers. For a list of all the available configurations
and their scope, please refer to [section 5 of the man page] [7].

``` bash
man 5 barman
```

### Configuration files directory

As of version 1.1.2, you can now specify a directory for configuration
files similarly to other Linux applications, using the
`configuration_files_directory` option (empty by default). If the
value of `configuration_files_directory` is a directory, Barman will
read all the files with `.conf` extension that exist in that folder.
For example, if you set it to `/etc/barman.d`, you can specify your
PostgreSQL servers placing each section in a separate `.conf` file
inside the `/etc/barman.d` folder.

Otherwise, you can use Barman's standard way of specifying sections
within the main configuration file.

### Lock files

Since version 1.5.0, Barman allows DBAs to specify a directory for
lock files through the `barman_lock_directory` global option.

Lock files are used to coordinate concurrent work at global and server
level (for example, cron operations, backup operations, access to the
WAL archive, etc.).

By default (for backward compatibility reasons),
`barman_lock_directory` is set to `barman_home`.

> **Important:**
> This change won't affect users upgrading from a version of Barman
> older than 1.5.0, unless you have written applications that depend
> on the names of the lock files. However, this is not a typical and
> common case for Barman and most of users do not fall into this
> category.

> **Tip:**
> Users are encouraged to use a directory in a volatile partition,
> such as the one dedicated to run-time variable data (e.g.
> `/var/run/barman`).

### Customisation of binary paths

As of version 1.6.0, Barman allows users to specify one or more directories
where Barman looks for executable files, using the global/server
option `path_prefix`.

If a `path_prefix` is provided, it must contain a list of one or more
directories separated by colon. Barman will search inside these directories
first, then in those specified by the `PATH` environment variable.

By default the `path_prefix` option is empty.

### Example of configuration

Here follows a basic example of PostgreSQL configuration:

``` ini
[barman]
barman_home = /var/lib/barman
barman_user = barman
log_file = /var/log/barman/barman.log
compression = gzip
reuse_backup = link
minimum_redundancy = 1

[main]
description = "Main PostgreSQL Database"
ssh_command = ssh postgres@pg
conninfo = host=pg user=postgres
```

For more detailed information, please refer to the distributed
`barman.conf` file.

### Initial checks

Once you have created your configuration file (or files), you can now
test Barman's configuration by executing:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman show-server main
barman@backup$ barman check main
```

Write down the `incoming_wals_directory`, as printed by the `barman
show-server main` command, because you will need it to setup
continuous WAL archiving.

> **Important:**
> The `barman check main` command automatically creates all the
> directories for the continuous backup of the `main` server.

### Continuous WAL archiving

Barman requires that continuous WAL archiving via PostgreSQL's
`archive_command` is properly configured on the master.
Edit the `postgresql.conf` file of the PostgreSQL instance on the `pg`
database and activate the archive mode:

``` ini
wal_level = 'archive' # For PostgreSQL >= 9.0
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'rsync -a %p barman@backup:INCOMING_WALS_DIRECTORY/%f'
```

Make sure you change the `INCOMING_WALS_DIRECTORY` placeholder with
the value returned by the `barman show-server main` command above.

In case you use Hot Standby, `wal_level` must be set to `hot_standby`.

Restart the PostgreSQL server.

In order to test that continuous archiving is on and properly working,
you need to check both the PostgreSQL server and the `backup` server
(in particular, that WAL files are correctly collected in the
destination directory).

> **Warning:**
> It is currently a requirement that WAL files from PostgreSQL are
> shipped to the Barman server. Without `archive_command` being
> properly set in PostgreSQL to send WAL files to Barman, **full
> backups cannot be taken**.

> **Important:**
> PostgreSQL 9.5 introduces support for WAL file archiving using
> `archive_command` from a standby. This feature is not yet implemented
> in Barman.

#### Reducing RPO with WAL streaming

From version 1.6.0, Barman improves its Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
performance by allowing users to add, on top of the standard `archive_command`
strategy, continuous WAL streaming from a PostgreSQL server.

Barman relies on [`pg_receivexlog`] [25], a utility that is available
from PostgreSQL 9.2 which exploits the native streaming replication protocol
and continuously receives transaction logs from a PostgreSQL
server (be it a master or a standby).

> **Important:**
> Barman requires that `pg_receivexlog` is installed in the same server.
> For PostgreSQL 9.2 servers, you need `pg_receivexlog` of version 9.2
> installed alongside with Barman. For PostgreSQL 9.3 and above, it is
> recommended to install the latest available version of `pg_receivexlog`,
> as it is back compatible.
> Otherwise, users can install multiple versions of `pg_receivexlog` in the
> Barman server and properly point to the specific version for a server,
> using the `path` option in the configuration file.

In order to enable streaming of transaction logs, you need to:

1. setup a streaming connection, as previously described;
2. set the `streaming_archiver` option to `on`.

The `cron` command, if the aforementioned requirements are met,
transparently manages log streaming through the execution of the
`receive-wal` command. This is the recommended scenario.

However, users can manually execute the `receive-wal` command:

``` bash
barman receive-wal <server_name>
```

> **Note:**
> The `receive-wal` command is a foreground process.

Transaction logs are streamed directly in the directory specified by the
`streaming_wal_directory` configuration option and are then archived
by the `archive-wal` command.

> **Important:**
> Currently, WAL streaming is only supported in Barman as an additional
> method for continuous archiving of transaction logs. Future versions of
> Barman will allow users of PostgreSQL 9.4 and above to rely exclusively
> on WAL streaming (and abandon the standard `archive_command` method),
> thanks to _replication slots_.
> Following our incremental development approach, version 1.6.0 aims to
> gradually introduce support of this feature in PostgreSQL Disaster Recovery
> solutions based on Barman. At the same time, users' feedback and production
> adoption will allow us to improve future versions and implement a
> "streaming-only" method of WAL archiving that is based on
> transparent management of replication slots in Barman.

##### Stopping a receive-wal process for a server

If a `receive-wal` process is running in background (e.g. started by
the cron command), it is possible to ask barman to stop it by invoking
the `receive-wal` command with the `--stop` option:

``` bash
barman receive-wal --stop <server_name>
```

## Listing the servers

The following command displays the list of all the available servers:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman list-server
```

## Executing a full backup

To take a backup for the `main` server, issue the following command:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman backup main
```

As of version 1.1.0, you can serialise the backup of your managed
servers by using the `all` target for the server:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman backup all
```

This will iterate through your available servers and sequentially take
a backup for each of them.

### Implicit restore point

As of version 1.5.1, at the end of a successful backup Barman
automatically creates a restore point that can be used jointly
with `--target-name` during recovery.

By default, the restore point name uses the following convention:
`barman_<backup_id>`.

Barman internally uses the PostgreSQL function called `pg_create_restore_point`:
for further information, please refer to the
[PostgreSQL documentation on system administration functions] [20].

> **Important:**
> This feature is only available for PostgreSQL 9.1 or above.

### Immediate Checkpoint

As of version 1.3.0, it is possible to use the `immediate_checkpoint`
configuration global/server option (set to `false` by default).

Before starting a backup, Barman requests a checkpoint, which
generates additional workload. Normally that checkpoint is throttled
according to the settings for workload control on the PostgreSQL
server, which means that the backup could be delayed.

If `immediate_checkpoint` is set to `true`, PostgreSQL will not try to
limit the workload, and the checkpoint will happen at maximum speed,
starting the backup as soon as possible.

At any time, you can override the configuration option behaviour, by
issuing `barman backup` with any of these two options:

- `--immediate-checkpoint`, which forces an immediate checkpoint;
- `--no-immediate-checkpoint`, which forces to wait for the checkpoint
  to happen.

## Viewing the list of backups for a server

To list all the available backups for a given server, issue:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman list-backup main
```

the format of the output is as in:

``` bash
main - 20120529T092136 - Wed May 30 15:20:25 2012 - Size: 5.0 TiB
 - WAL Size: 845.0 GiB (tablespaces: a:/disk1/a, t:/disk2/t)
```

where `20120529T092136` is the ID of the backup and `Wed May 30
15:20:25 2012` is the start time of the operation, `Size` is the size
of the base backup and `WAL Size` is the size of the archived WAL files.

As of version 1.1.2, you can get a listing of the available backups
for all your servers, using the `all` target for the server:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman list-backup all
```

## Restoring a whole server

To restore a whole server issue the following command:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman recover main 20110920T185953 /path/to/recover/dir
```

where `20110920T185953` is the ID of the backup to be restored. When
this command completes successfully, `/path/to/recover/dir`
contains a complete data directory ready to be started as a PostgreSQL
database server.

Here is an example of a command that starts the server:

``` bash
barman@backup$ pg_ctl -D /path/to/recover/dir start
```

> **Important:**
> If you run this command as user `barman`, it will become the
> database superuser.

You can retrieve a list of backup IDs for a specific server with:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman list-backup srvpgsql
```

> **Important:**
> Barman does not currently keep track of symbolic links inside PGDATA
> (except for tablespaces inside `pg_tblspc`). We encourage system
> administrators to keep track of symbolic links and to add them to the
> disaster recovery plans/procedures in case they need to be restored
> in their original location.

## Remote recovery

Barman is able to recover a backup on a remote server through the
`--remote-ssh-command COMMAND` option for the `recover` command.

If this option is specified, barman uses `COMMAND` to connect to a
remote host.

Here is an example of a command that starts recovery on a remote server:

``` bash
barman@backup$ barman recover --remote-ssh-command="ssh user@remotehost" \
main 20110920T185953 /path/to/recover/dir
```

> **Note:**
> The `postgres` user is normally used to recover on a remote host.

There are some limitations when using remote recovery. It is important
to be aware that:

- unless `get-wal` is specified in the `recovery_options` (available
  from version 1.5.0), Barman requires at least 4GB of free space in
  the system's temporary directory (usually `/tmp`);
- the SSH connection between Barman and the remote host **must** use
  public key exchange authentication method;
- the remote user must be able to create the required destination
  directories for `PGDATA` and, where applicable, tablespaces;
- there must be enough free space on the remote server to contain the
  base backup and the WAL files needed for recovery.

## Relocating one or more tablespaces

> **Important:**
> As of version 1.3.0, it is possible to relocate a tablespace both
> with local and remote recovery.

Barman is able to automatically relocate one or more tablespaces using
the `recover` command with the `--tablespace` option. The option
accepts a pair of values as arguments using the `NAME:DIRECTORY`
format:

- name/identifier of the tablespace (`NAME`);
- destination directory (`DIRECTORY`).

If the destination directory does not exists, Barman will try to
create it (assuming you have enough privileges).

## Restoring to a given point in time

Barman employs PostgreSQL's Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) by allowing
DBAs to specify a recovery target, either as a timestamp or as a
transaction ID; you can also specify whether the recovery target
should be included or not in the recovery.

The recovery target can be specified using one of three mutually
exclusive options:

- `--target-time TARGET_TIME`: to specify a timestamp
- `--target-xid TARGET_XID`: to specify a transaction ID
- `--target-name TARGET_NAME`: to specify a named restore point -
  previously created with the `pg_create_restore_point(name)`
  function[^POSTGRESQL0901]

[^POSTGRESQL0901]: Only available on PostgreSQL 9.1 and above.

You can use the `--exclusive` option to specify whether to stop
immediately before or immediately after the recovery target.

Barman allows you to specify a target timeline for recovery, using the
`target-tli` option. The notion of timeline goes beyond the scope of
this document; you can find more details in the PostgreSQL
documentation, or in one of 2ndQuadrant's Recovery training courses.

## Retry of copy in backup/recovery operations

As of version 1.3.3, it is possible to take advantage of two new
options in Barman:

- `basebackup_retry_times` (set to 0 by default)
- `basebackup_retry_sleep` (set to 30 by default)

When issuing a backup or a recovery, Barman normally tries to copy the
base backup once. If the copy fails (e.g. due to network problems),
Barman terminates the operation with a failure.

By setting `basebackup_retry_times`, Barman will try to re-execute a
copy operation as many times as requested by the user. The
`basebackup_retry_sleep` option specifies the number of seconds that
Barman will wait between each attempt.

At any time you can override the configuration option behaviour from
the command line, when issuing `barman backup` or `barman recover`,
using:

- `--retry-times <retry_number>` (same logic as
  `basebackup_retry_times`)
- `--no-retry` (same as `--retry-times 0`)
- `--retry-sleep <number_of_seconds>` (same logic as
  `basebackup_retry_sleep`)

# Available commands

Barman commands are applied to three different levels:

- **general** commands, which apply to the backup catalogue
- **server** commands, which apply to a specific server (list
  available backups, execute a backup, etc.)
- **backup** commands, which apply to a specific backup in the
  catalogue (display information, issue a recovery, delete the backup,
  etc.)

In the following sections the available commands will be described in
detail.

## General commands

### List available servers

You can display the list of active servers that have been configured
for your backup system with:

``` bash
barman list-server
```

### Maintenance mode

#### Cron command

You can perform maintenance operations, on both WAL files and backups,
using the command:


``` bash
barman cron
```


As of version 1.5.1 `barman cron` executes WAL archiving operations
concurrently on a server basis.

This also enforces retention policies on those servers that have:


- `retention_policy` not empty and valid;
- `retention_policy_mode` set to `auto`.


> **Note:**
> This command should be executed in a _cron script_. Our
> recommendation is to schedule `barman cron` to run every minute.


#### Archive-wal command

As of version 1.5.1, Barman introduces the `archive-wal` command:


``` bash
barman archive-wal <server_name>
```

This is the command responsible for WAL maintenance operations,
like compressing WAL files and moving them from the _incoming directory_
(if `archiver` is enabled) or the _streaming directory_ (if
`streaming_archiver` is enabled)  into the archive.

Although it can be manually executed, the majority of users will not
need to do it, given that it is transparently invoked as a subprocess
by the `cron` command, as part of the standard maintenance operations
for every server.

## Server commands

### Show the configuration for a given server

You can show the configuration parameters for a given server with:

``` bash
barman show-server <server_name>
```

### Take a base backup

You can perform a full backup (base backup) for a given server with:

``` bash
barman backup [--immediate-checkpoint] <server_name>
```

> **Tip:**
> You can use `barman backup all` to sequentially backup all your
> configured servers.


### Show available backups for a server

You can list the catalogue of available backups for a given server
with:

``` bash
barman list-backup <server_name>
```

### Check a server is properly working

You can check if the connection to a given server is properly working
with:

``` bash
barman check <server_name>
```

> **Tip:**
> You can use `barman check all` to check all your configured servers.

From version 1.3.3, you can automatically be notified if the latest
backup of a given server is older than, for example, _7
days_.[^SMELLY_BACKUP]

[^SMELLY_BACKUP]:
  This feature is commonly known among the development team members as
  _smelly backup check_.

Barman introduces the option named `last_backup_maximum_age` having
the following syntax:

``` ini
last_backup_maximum_age = {value {DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS}}
```

where `value` is a positive integer representing the number of days,
weeks or months of the time frame.

### Diagnose a Barman installation

You can gather important information about all the configured server
using:

``` bash
barman diagnose
```

The `diagnose` command also provides other useful information, such as
global configuration, SSH version, Python version, `rsync` version, as
well as current configuration and status of all servers.

> **Tip:**
> You can use `barman diagnose` when you want to ask questions or
> report errors to Barman developers, providing them with all the
> information about your issue.

### Rebuild the WAL archive

At any time, you can regenerate the content of the WAL archive for a
specific server (or every server, using the `all` shortcut). The WAL
archive is contained in the `xlog.db` file, and every Barman server
has its own copy. From version 1.2.4 you can now rebuild the `xlog.db`
file with the `rebuild-xlogdb` command. This will scan all the
archived WAL files and regenerate the metadata for the archive.

> **Important:**
> Users of Barman < 1.2.3 might have suffered from a bug due to bad
> locking in highly concurrent environments. You can now regenerate
> the WAL archive using the `rebuild-xlogdb` command.

``` bash
barman rebuild-xlogdb <server_name>
```

### Access WAL archive using `get-wal`

From version 1.5.0, Barman allows users to request any _xlog_ file
from its WAL archive through the `get-wal` command:

``` bash
barman get-wal [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-j|-x] <server_name> <wal_id>
```

If the requested WAL file is found in the server archive, the
uncompressed content will be returned to `STDOUT`, unless otherwise
specified.

The following options are available for the `get-wal` command:

- `-o` allows users to specify a destination directory where Barman
  will deposit the requested WAL file
- `-j` will compress the output using `bzip2` algorithm
- `-x` will compress the output using `gzip` algorithm

It is possible to use `get-wal` during a recovery operation,
transforming the Barman server in a _WAL hub_ for your servers. This
can be automatically achieved by adding the `get-wal` value to the
`recovery_options` global/server configuration option:

``` ini
recovery_options = 'get-wal'
```

`recovery_options` is a global/server option that accepts a list of
comma separated values. If the keyword `get-wal` is present, during a
recovery operation Barman will prepare the `recovery.conf` file by
setting the `restore_command` so that `barman get-wal` is used to
fetch the required WAL files.

This is an example of a `restore_command` for a remote recovery:

``` ini
restore_command = 'ssh barman@pgbackup barman get-wal SERVER %f > %p'
```

This is an example of a `restore_command` for a local recovery:

``` ini
restore_command = 'barman get-wal SERVER %f > %p'
```

> **Important:**
> Even though `recovery_options` aims to automate the process, using
> the `get-wal` facility requires manual intervention and proper
> testing.

## Backup commands

> **Note:**
> Remember: a backup ID can be retrieved with `barman list-backup
> <server_name>`

### Show backup information

You can show all the available information for a particular backup of
a given server with:

``` bash
barman show-backup <server_name> <backup_id>
```

From version 1.1.2, in order to show the latest backup, you can issue:

``` bash
barman show-backup <server_name> latest
```

### Delete a backup

You can delete a given backup with:

``` bash
barman delete <server_name> <backup_id>
```

From version 1.1.2, in order to delete the oldest backup, you can
issue:

``` bash
barman delete <server_name> oldest
```

### List backup files

You can list the files (base backup and required WAL files) for a
given backup with:

``` bash
barman list-files [--target TARGET_TYPE] <server_name> <backup_id>
```

With the `--target TARGET_TYPE` option, it is possible to choose the
content of the list for a given backup.

Possible values for `TARGET_TYPE` are:

- `data`: lists just the data files;
- `standalone`: lists the base backup files, including required WAL
  files;
- `wal`: lists all WAL files from the beginning of the base backup to
  the start of the following one (or until the end of the log);
- `full`: same as `data` + `wal`.

The default value for `TARGET_TYPE` is `standalone`.

> **Important:**
> The `list-files` command facilitates interaction with external
> tools, and therefore can be extremely useful to integrate > Barman
> into your archiving procedures.


# Main features

## Incremental backup

From version 1.4.0, Barman implements **file-level incremental
backup**. Incremental backup is a kind of full periodic backup which
saves only data changes from the latest full backup available in the
catalogue for a specific PostgreSQL server. It must not be confused
with differential backup, which is implemented by _WAL continuous
archiving_.

The main goals of incremental backup in Barman are:

- Reduce the time taken for the full backup process
- Reduce the disk space occupied by several periodic backups (**data
  deduplication**)

This feature heavily relies on `rsync` and [hard links] [8], which
must be therefore supported by both the underlying operating system
and the file system where the backup data resides.

The main concept is that a subsequent base backup will share those
files that have not changed since the previous backup, leading to
relevant savings in disk usage. This is particularly true of VLDB
contexts and, more in general, of those databases containing a high
percentage of _read-only historical tables_.

Barman implements incremental backup through a global/server option,
called `reuse_backup`, that transparently manages the `barman backup`
command. It accepts three values:

- `off`: standard full backup (default)
- `link`: incremental backup, by reusing the last backup for a server
  and creating a hard link of the unchanged files (for backup space
  and time reduction)
- `copy`: incremental backup, by reusing the last backup for a server
  and creating a copy of the unchanged files (just for backup time
  reduction)

The most common scenario is to set `reuse_backup` to `link`, as
follows:

``` ini
reuse_backup = link
```

Setting this at global level will automatically enable incremental
backup for all your servers.

As a final note, users can override the setting of the `reuse_backup`
option through the `--reuse-backup` runtime option for the `barman
backup` command. Similarly, the runtime option accepts three values:
`off`, `link` and `copy`. For example, you can run a one-off
incremental backup as follows:

``` bash
barman backup --reuse-backup=link <server_name>
```

## WAL compression

The `barman cron` command (see below) will compress WAL files if the
`compression` option is set in the configuration file. This option
allows five values:

- `bzip2`: for Bzip2 compression (requires the `bzip2` utility)
- `gzip`: for Gzip compression (requires the `gzip` utility)
- `pybzip2`: for Bzip2 compression (uses Python's internal compression module)
- `pygzip`: for Gzip compression (uses Python's internal compression module)
- `pigz`: for Pigz compression (requires the `pigz` utility)
- `custom`: for custom compression, which requires you to set the
  following options as well:
      - `custom_compression_filter`: a compression filter
      - `custom_decompression_filter`: a decompression filter

> *NOTE:* The `pybzip2`, `pygzip` and `pigz` options for standard
> compression have been introduced in Barman 1.6.0. All methods but
> `pybzip2` and `pygzip` require `barman archive-wal` to fork a new
> process.

## Limiting bandwidth usage

From version 1.2.1, it is possible to limit the usage of I/O bandwidth
through the `bandwidth_limit` option (global/per server), by
specifying the maximum number of kilobytes per second. By default it
is set to 0, meaning no limit.

In case you have several tablespaces and you prefer to limit the I/O
workload of your backup procedures on one or more tablespaces, you can
use the `tablespace_bandwidth_limit` option (global/per server):

``` ini
tablespace_bandwidth_limit = tbname:bwlimit[, tbname:bwlimit, ...]
```

The option accepts a comma separated list of pairs made up of the
tablespace name and the bandwidth limit (in kilobytes per second).

When backing up a server, Barman will try and locate any existing
tablespace in the above option. If found, the specified bandwidth
limit will be enforced. If not, the default bandwidth limit for that
server will be applied.

## Network Compression

From version 1.3.0 it is possible to reduce the size of transferred
data using compression. It can be enabled using the
`network_compression` option (global/per server):

``` ini
network_compression = true|false
```

Setting this option to `true` will enable data compression during
network transfers (for both backup and recovery). By default it is set
to `false`.

## Backup ID shortcuts

As of version 1.1.2, you can use any of the following **shortcuts** to
identify a particular backup for a given server:

- `latest`: the latest available backup for that server, in
  chronological order. You can also use the `last` synonym.
- `oldest`: the oldest available backup for that server, in
  chronological order. You can also use the `first` synonym.

These aliases can be used with any of the following commands:
`show-backup`, `delete`, `list-files` and `recover`.

## Minimum redundancy safety

From version 1.2.0, you can define the minimum number of periodic
backups for a PostgreSQL server.

You can use the global/per server configuration option called
`minimum_redundancy` for this purpose, by default set to 0.

By setting this value to any number greater than 0, Barman makes sure
that at any time you will have at least that number of backups in a
server catalogue.

This will protect you from accidental `barman delete` operations.

> **Important:**
> Make sure that your policy retention settings do not collide with
> minimum redundancy requirements. Regularly check Barman's log for
> messages on this topic.

## Retention policies

From version 1.2.0, Barman supports **retention policies** for
backups.

A backup retention policy is an user-defined policy that determines
how long backups and related archive logs (Write Ahead Log segments)
need to be retained for recovery procedures.

Based on the user's request, Barman retains the periodic backups
required to satisfy the current retention policy, and any archived WAL
files required for the complete recovery of those backups.

Barman users can define a retention policy in terms of **backup
redundancy** (how many periodic backups) or a **recovery window** (how
long).

Retention policy based on redundancy

  : In a redundancy based retention policy, the user determines how
    many periodic backups to keep. A redundancy-based retention policy
    is contrasted with retention policies that use a recovery window.

Retention policy based on recovery window

  : A recovery window is one type of Barman backup retention policy,
    in which the DBA specifies a period of time and Barman ensures
    retention of backups and/or archived WAL files required for
    point-in-time recovery to any time during the recovery window. The
    interval always ends with the current time and extends back in
    time for the number of days specified by the user. For example, if
    the retention policy is set for a recovery window of seven days,
    and the current time is 9:30 AM on Friday, Barman retains the
    backups required to allow point-in-time recovery back to 9:30 AM
    on the previous Friday.

### Scope

Retention policies can be defined for:

- **PostgreSQL periodic base backups**: through the `retention_policy`
  configuration option;
- **Archive logs**, for Point-In-Time-Recovery: through the
  `wal_retention_policy` configuration option.

> **Important:**
> In a temporal dimension, archive logs must be included in the time
> window of periodic backups.

There are two typical use cases here: full or partial point-in-time
recovery.

Full point in time recovery scenario

  : Base backups and archive logs share the same retention policy,
    allowing DBAs to recover at any point in time from the first
    available backup.

Partial point in time recovery scenario

  : Base backup retention policy is wider than that of archive logs,
    allowing users for example to keep full weekly backups of the last
    6 months, but archive logs for the last 4 weeks (granting to
    recover at any point in time starting from the last 4 periodic
    weekly backups).

> **Important:**
> Currently, Barman implements only the **full point in time
> recovery** scenario, by constraining the `wal_retention_policy`
> option to `main`.

### How they work

Retention policies in Barman can be:

- **automated**: enforced by `barman cron`;
- **manual**: Barman simply reports obsolete backups and allows DBAs
  to delete them.

> **Important:**
> Currently Barman does not implement manual enforcement. This feature
> will be available in future versions.

### Configuration and syntax

Retention policies can be defined through the following configuration
options:

- `retention_policy`: for base backup retention;
- `wal_retention_policy`: for archive logs retention;
- `retention_policy_mode`: can only be set to `auto` (retention
  policies are automatically enforced by the `barman cron` command).

These configuration options can be defined both at a global level and
a server level, allowing users maximum flexibility on a multi-server
environment.

#### Syntax for `retention_policy`

The general syntax for a base backup retention policy through
`retention_policy` is the following:

``` ini
retention_policy = {REDUNDANCY value | RECOVERY WINDOW OF value {DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS}}
```

Where:

- syntax is case insensitive;
- `value` is an integer and is > 0;
- in case of **redundancy retention policy**:
      - `value` must be greater than or equal to the server minimum
        redundancy level (if not is is assigned to that value and a
        warning is generated);
      - the first valid backup is the value-th backup in a reverse
        ordered time series;
- in case of **recovery window policy**:
      - the point of recoverability is: current time - window;
      - the first valid backup is the first available backup before
        the point of recoverability; its value in a reverse ordered
        time series must be greater than or equal to the server
        minimum redundancy level (if not is is assigned to that value
        and a warning is generated).

By default, `retention_policy` is empty (no retention enforced).

#### Syntax for `wal_retention_policy`

Currently, the only allowed value for `wal_retention_policy` is the
special value `main`, that maps the retention policy of archive logs
to that of base backups.

## Concurrent Backup and backup from a standby

Normally, during backup operations, Barman uses PostgreSQL native
functions `pg_start_backup` and `pg_stop_backup` for _exclusive
backup_. These operations are not allowed on a read-only standby
server.

As of version 1.3.1, Barman is also capable of performing backups of
PostgreSQL 9.2/9.3 database servers in a **concurrent way**, primarily
through the `backup_options` configuration
parameter.[^ABOUT_CONCURRENT_BACKUP]

[^ABOUT_CONCURRENT_BACKUP]:
  Concurrent backup is a technology that has been available in
  PostgreSQL since version 9.1, through the _streaming replication
  protocol_ (using, for example, a tool like `pg_basebackup`).

This introduces a new architecture scenario with Barman: **backup from
a standby server**, using `rsync`.

> **Important:**
> **Concurrent backup** requires users of PostgreSQL 9.2 and 9.3 to
> install the `pgespresso` open source extension on the PostgreSQL
> server. For more detailed information and the source code, please
> visit the [pgespresso extension website] [9].

By default, `backup_options` is transparently set to
`exclusive_backup` (the only supported method by any Barman version
prior to 1.3.1).

When `backup_options` is set to `concurrent_backup`, Barman activates
the _concurrent backup mode_ for a server and follows these two simple
rules:

- `ssh_command` must point to the destination Postgres server;
- `conninfo` must point to a database on the destination Postgres 9.2
  or 9.3 server where `pgespresso` is correctly installed through
  `CREATE EXTENSION`.

The destination Postgres server can be either the master or a
streaming replicated standby server.

> **Note:**
> When backing up from a standby server, continuous archiving of WAL
> files must be configured on the master to ship files to the Barman
> server (as outlined in the "Continuous WAL archiving" section
> above)[^CONCURRENT_ARCHIVING].

[^CONCURRENT_ARCHIVING]:
  In case of concurrent backup, currently Barman does not have a way
  to determine that the closing WAL file of a full backup has actually
  been shipped - opposite to the case of an exclusive backup where it
  is Postgres itself that makes sure that the WAL file is correctly
  archived. Be aware that the full backup cannot be considered
  consistent until that WAL file has been received and archived by
  Barman. We encourage Barman users to wait to delete the previous
  backup - at least until that moment.

## Hook scripts

Barman allows a database administrator to run _hook scripts_ on these
two events:

- before and after a backup
- before and after a WAL file is archived

There are two types of hook scripts that Barman can manage:

- standard hook scripts (already present in Barman since version
  1.1.0)
- retry hook scripts, introduced in version 1.5.0

The only difference between these two types of hook scripts is that
Barman executes a standard hook script only once, without checking its
return code, whereas a retry hook script may be executed more than
once depending on its return code.

Precisely, when executing a retry hook script, Barman checks the
return code and retries indefinitely until the script returns either
`SUCCESS` (with standard return code `0`), or `ABORT_CONTINUE` (return
code `62`), or `ABORT_STOP` (return code `63`). Barman treats any
other return code as a transient failure to be retried. Users are
given more power: a hook script can control its workflow by specifying
whether a failure is transient. Also, in case of a 'pre' hook script,
by returning `ABORT_STOP`, users can request Barman to interrupt the
main operation with a failure.

Hook scripts are executed in the following order:

1. The standard 'pre' hook script (if present)
2. The retry 'pre' hook script (if present)
3. The actual event (i.e. backup operation, or WAL archiving), if
   retry 'pre' hook script was not aborted with `ABORT_STOP`
4. The retry 'post' hook script (if present)
5. The standard 'post' hook script (if present)

The output generated by any hook script is written in the log file of
Barman.

> **Note:**
> Currently, `ABORT_STOP` is ignored by retry 'post' hook scripts. In
> these cases, apart from lodging an additional warning, `ABORT_STOP`
> will behave like `ABORT_CONTINUE`.

### Backup scripts

Version 1.1.0 introduced backup scripts.

These scripts can be configured with the following global
configuration options (which can be overridden on a per server basis):

- `pre_backup_script`: _hook script_ executed _before_ a base backup,
  only once, with no check on the exit code
- `pre_backup_retry_script`: _retry hook script_ executed _before_ a
  base backup, repeatedly until success or abort
- `post_backup_retry_script`: _retry hook script_ executed _after_ a
  base backup, repeatedly until success or abort
- `post_backup_script`: _hook script_ executed _after_ a base backup,
  only once, with no check on the exit code

The script definition is passed to a shell and can return any exit
code. Only in case of a _retry_ script, Barman checks the return code
(see the upper section).

The shell environment will contain the following variables:

- `BARMAN_BACKUP_DIR`: backup destination directory
- `BARMAN_BACKUP_ID`: ID of the backup
- `BARMAN_CONFIGURATION`: configuration file used by barman
- `BARMAN_ERROR`: error message, if any (only for the `post` phase)
- `BARMAN_PHASE`: phase of the script, either `pre` or `post`
- `BARMAN_PREVIOUS_ID`: ID of the previous backup (if present)
- `BARMAN_RETRY`: `1` if it is a retry script (from 1.5.0), `0` if not
- `BARMAN_SERVER`: name of the server
- `BARMAN_STATUS`: status of the backup
- `BARMAN_VERSION`: version of Barman (from 1.2.1)

### WAL archive scripts

Version 1.3.0 introduced WAL archive hook scripts.

Similarly to backup scripts, archive scripts can be configured with
global configuration options (which can be overridden on a per server
basis):

- `pre_archive_script`: _hook script_ executed _before_ a WAL file is
  archived by maintenance (usually `barman cron`), only once, with no
  check on the exit code
- `pre_archive_retry_script`: _retry hook script_ executed _before_ a
  WAL file is archived by maintenance (usually `barman cron`),
  repeatedly until success or abort
- `post_archive_retry_script`: _retry hook script_ executed _after_ a
  WAL file is archived by maintenance, repeatedly until success or
  abort
- `post_archive_script`: _hook script_ executed _after_ a WAL file is
  archived by maintenance, only once, with no check on the exit code

The script is executed through a shell and can return any exit code.
Only in case of a _retry_ script, Barman checks the return code (see
the upper section).

Archive scripts share with backup scripts some environmental
variables:

- `BARMAN_CONFIGURATION`: configuration file used by barman
- `BARMAN_ERROR`: error message, if any (only for the `post` phase)
- `BARMAN_PHASE`: phase of the script, either `pre` or `post`
- `BARMAN_SERVER`: name of the server

Following variables are specific to archive scripts:

- `BARMAN_SEGMENT`: name of the WAL file
- `BARMAN_FILE`: full path of the WAL file
- `BARMAN_SIZE`: size of the WAL file
- `BARMAN_TIMESTAMP`: WAL file timestamp
- `BARMAN_COMPRESSION`: type of compression used for the WAL file


## Integration with standby servers

Barman has been designed for integration with standby servers (with
streaming replication or traditional file based log shipping) and high
availability tools like [repmgr] [10].

From an architectural point of view, PostgreSQL must be configured to
archive WAL files directly to the Barman server.
