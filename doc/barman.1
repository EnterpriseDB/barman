.TP
.B put\-wal \f[I][OPTIONS]\f[] \f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[]
Receive a WAL file from a remote server and securely store it into the
\f[C]SERVER_NAME\f[] incoming directory.
The WAL file is retrieved from the \f[C]STDIN\f[], and must be
encapsulated in a tar stream together with a \f[C]MD5SUMS\f[] file to
validate it.
This command is meant to be invoked through SSH from a remote
\f[C]barman\-wal\-archive\f[] utility (part of \f[C]barman\-cli\f[]
package).
Do not use this command directly unless you take full responsibility of
the content of files.
.RS

file, and every Barman server has its own copy.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B receive\-wal \f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[]

Recover the specified timeline.
The special values \f[C]current\f[] and \f[C]latest\f[] can be used in
addition to a numeric timeline ID.
The default behaviour for PostgreSQL versions >= 12 is to recover to the
\f[C]latest\f[] timeline in the WAL archive.
The default for PostgreSQL versions < 12 is to recover along the
timeline which was current when the backup was taken.
.RS
