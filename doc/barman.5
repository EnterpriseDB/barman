.SH NAME
.PP
barman \- Backup and Recovery Manager for PostgreSQL
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Barman is an administration tool for disaster recovery of PostgreSQL
servers written in Python and maintained by 2ndQuadrant.
Barman can perform remote backups of multiple servers in business
critical environments and helps DBAs during the recovery phase.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATIONS
.PP
The system\-level Barman configuration file is located at
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman.conf
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman/barman.conf
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and is overridden on a per\-user level by
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$HOME/.barman.conf
\f[R]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
.PP
The Barman configuration file is a plain \f[C]INI\f[R] file.
There is a general section called \f[C][barman]\f[R] and a section
\f[C][servername]\f[R] for each server you want to backup.
Rows starting with \f[C];\f[R] are comments.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTORY
.PP
Barman supports the inclusion of multiple configuration files, through
the \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[R] option.
Included files must contain only server specifications, not global
configurations.
If the value of \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[R] is a directory,
Barman reads all files with \f[C].conf\f[R] extension that exist in that
folder.
For example, if you set it to \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[R], you can specify
your PostgreSQL servers placing each section in a separate
\f[C].conf\f[R] file inside the \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[R] folder.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B active
When set to \f[C]true\f[R] (default), the server is in full operational
state.
When set to \f[C]false\f[R], the server can be used for diagnostics, but
any operational command such as backup execution or WAL archiving is
temporarily disabled.
Setting \f[C]active=false\f[R] is a good practice when adding a new node
to Barman.
Server.
.TP
.B archiver
This option allows you to activate log file shipping through
PostgreSQL\[aq]s \f[C]archive_command\f[R] for a server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[R] (default), Barman expects that continuous
archiving for a server is in place and will activate checks as well as
management (including compression) of WAL files that Postgres deposits
in the \f[I]incoming\f[R] directory.
Setting it to \f[C]false\f[R], will disable standard continuous
archiving for a server.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B archiver_batch_size
This option allows you to activate batch processing of WAL files for the
\f[C]archiver\f[R] process, by setting it to a value > 0.
Otherwise, the traditional unlimited processing of the WAL queue is
enabled.
When batch processing is activated, the \f[C]archive\-wal\f[R] process
would limit itself to maximum \f[C]archiver_batch_size\f[R] WAL segments
per single run.
Integer.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B backup_directory
Directory where backup data for a server will be placed.
Server.
.TP
.B backup_method
Configure the method barman used for backup execution.
If set to \f[C]rsync\f[R] (default), barman will execute backup using
the \f[C]rsync\f[R] command.
If set to \f[C]postgres\f[R] barman will use the \f[C]pg_basebackup\f[R]
command to execute the backup.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B backup_options
This option allows you to control the way Barman interacts with
PostgreSQL for backups.
It is a comma\-separated list of values that accepts the following
options:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]exclusive_backup\f[R] (default when
\f[C]backup_method = rsync\f[R]): \f[C]barman backup\f[R] executes
backup operations using the standard exclusive backup approach
(technically through \f[C]pg_start_backup\f[R] and
\f[C]pg_stop_backup\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]concurrent_backup\f[R] (default when
\f[C]backup_method = postgres\f[R]): if using PostgreSQL 9.2, 9.3, 9.4,
and 9.5, Barman requires the \f[C]pgespresso\f[R] module to be installed
on the PostgreSQL server and can be used to perform a backup from a
standby server.
Starting from PostgreSQL 9.6, Barman uses the new PostgreSQL API to
perform backups from a standby server.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]external_configuration\f[R]: if present, any warning regarding
external configuration files is suppressed during the execution of a
backup.
.PP
Note that \f[C]exclusive_backup\f[R] and \f[C]concurrent_backup\f[R] are
mutually exclusive.
Global/Server.
.RE
.TP

per second.
A value of zero specifies no limit (default).
Global/Server.
.TP
.B barman_home
Main data directory for Barman.
Global.
.TP
.B barman_lock_directory
Directory for locks.
Default: \f[C]%(barman_home)s\f[R].

.TP
.B basebackup_retry_sleep
Number of seconds of wait after a failed copy, before retrying Used
during both backup and recovery operations.
Positive integer, default 30.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B basebackup_retry_times
Number of retries of base backup copy, after an error.
Used during both backup and recovery operations.
Positive integer, default 0.
Global/Server.
.TP

Global/Server.
.TP
.B compression
Standard compression algorithm applied to WAL files.
Possible values are: \f[C]gzip\f[R] (requires \f[C]gzip\f[R] to be
installed on the system), \f[C]bzip2\f[R] (requires \f[C]bzip2\f[R]),
\f[C]pigz\f[R] (requires \f[C]pigz\f[R]), \f[C]pygzip\f[R] (Python\[aq]s
internal gzip compressor) and \f[C]pybzip2\f[R] (Python\[aq]s internal
bzip2 compressor).
Global/Server.
.TP
.B conninfo
Connection string used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server.
This is a libpq connection string, consult the PostgreSQL
manual (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING)
for more information.
Commonly used keys are: host, hostaddr, port, dbname, user, password.
Server.
.TP

Server.
.TP
.B errors_directory
Directory that contains WAL files that contain an error; usually this is
related to a conflict with an existing WAL file (e.g.
a WAL file that has been archived after a streamed one).
.TP
.B immediate_checkpoint
This option allows you to control the way PostgreSQL handles checkpoint
at the start of the backup.
If set to \f[C]false\f[R] (default), the I/O workload for the checkpoint
will be limited, according to the \f[C]checkpoint_completion_target\f[R]
setting on the PostgreSQL server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[R], an immediate checkpoint will be requested,
meaning that PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as
possible.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B incoming_wals_directory
Directory where incoming WAL files are archived into.
Requires \f[C]archiver\f[R] to be enabled.
Server.
.TP
.B last_backup_maximum_age
This option identifies a time frame that must contain the latest backup.
If the latest backup is older than the time frame, barman check command
will report an error to the user.
If empty (default), latest backup is always considered valid.
Syntax for this option is: \[dq]i (DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS)\[dq] where i
is a integer greater than zero, representing the number of days | weeks
| months of the time frame.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B log_file

Minimum number of backups to be retained.
Default 0.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B network_compression
This option allows you to enable data compression for network transfers.
If set to \f[C]false\f[R] (default), no compression is used.
If set to \f[C]true\f[R], compression is enabled, reducing network
usage.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B parallel_jobs
This option controls how many parallel workers will copy files during a
backup or recovery command.
Default 1.
Global/Server.
For backup purposes, it works only when \f[C]backup_method\f[R] is
\f[C]rsync\f[R].
.TP
.B path_prefix
One or more absolute paths, separated by colon, where Barman looks for
executable files.
The paths specified in \f[C]path_prefix\f[R] are tried before the ones
specified in \f[C]PATH\f[R] environment variable.
Global/server.
.TP
.B post_archive_retry_script
Hook script launched after a WAL file is archived by maintenance.
Being this a \f[I]retry\f[R] hook script, Barman will retry the
execution of the script until this either returns a SUCCESS (0), an
ABORT_CONTINUE (62) or an ABORT_STOP (63) code.

installation rather than a PostgreSQL server.
If \f[C]primary_ssh_command\f[R] is specified, Barman uses it to
enstablish a connection with the primary server.
Empty by default, it can also be set globally.
.TP
.B recovery_options
Options for recovery operations.
Currently only supports \f[C]get\-wal\f[R].
\f[C]get\-wal\f[R] activates generation of a basic
\f[C]restore_command\f[R] in the resulting \f[C]recovery.conf\f[R] file

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]off\f[R]: disabled (default);
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]copy\f[R]: reuse the last available backup for a server and create
a copy of the unchanged files (reduce backup time);
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]link\f[R]: reuse the last available backup for a server and create
a hard link of the unchanged files (reduce backup time and space).
Requires operating system and file system support for hard links.
.RE
.TP
.B slot_name
Physical replication slot to be used by the \f[C]receive\-wal\f[R]
command when \f[C]streaming_archiver\f[R] is set to \f[C]on\f[R].
Requires PostgreSQL >= 9.4.
Global/Server.
Default: None (disabled).
.TP
.B ssh_command
Command used by Barman to login to the Postgres server via ssh.
Server.
.TP
.B streaming_archiver
This option allows you to use the PostgreSQL\[aq]s streaming protocol to
receive transaction logs from a server.
If set to \f[C]on\f[R], Barman expects to find \f[C]pg_receivewal\f[R]
(known as \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[R] prior to PostgreSQL 10) in the PATH
(see \f[C]path_prefix\f[R] option) and that streaming connection for the
server is working.
This activates connection checks as well as management (including
compression) of WAL files.
If set to \f[C]off\f[R] (default) barman will rely only on continuous
archiving for a server WAL archive operations, eventually terminating
any running \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[R] for the server.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B streaming_archiver_batch_size
This option allows you to activate batch processing of WAL files for the
\f[C]streaming_archiver\f[R] process, by setting it to a value > 0.
Otherwise, the traditional unlimited processing of the WAL queue is
enabled.
When batch processing is activated, the \f[C]archive\-wal\f[R] process
would limit itself to maximum \f[C]streaming_archiver_batch_size\f[R]
WAL segments per single run.
Integer.
Global/Server.
.TP
.B streaming_archiver_name
Identifier to be used as \f[C]application_name\f[R] by the
\f[C]receive\-wal\f[R] command.
Only available with \f[C]pg_receivewal\f[R] (or \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[R]
>= 9.3).
By default it is set to \f[C]barman_receive_wal\f[R].
Global/Server.
.TP
.B streaming_backup_name
Identifier to be used as \f[C]application_name\f[R] by the
\f[C]pg_basebackup\f[R] command.
Only available with \f[C]pg_basebackup\f[R] >= 9.3.
By default it is set to \f[C]barman_streaming_backup\f[R].
Global/Server.
.TP
.B streaming_conninfo
Connection string used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server via
streaming replication protocol.
By default it is set to \f[C]conninfo\f[R].
Server.
.TP
.B streaming_wals_directory
Directory where WAL files are streamed from the PostgreSQL server to
Barman.
Requires \f[C]streaming_archiver\f[R] to be enabled.
Server.
.TP
.B tablespace_bandwidth_limit
This option allows you to specify a maximum transfer rate in kilobytes
per second, by specifying a comma separated list of tablespaces (pairs
TBNAME:BWLIMIT).
A value of zero specifies no limit (default).
Global/Server.
.TP
.B wal_retention_policy
Policy for retention of archive logs (WAL files).
Currently only \[dq]MAIN\[dq] is available.
