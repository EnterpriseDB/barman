.SH NAME
.PP
barman \- Backup and Recovery Manager for PostgreSQL
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Barman is an administration tool for disaster recovery of PostgreSQL
servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
Barman can perform remote backups of multiple servers in business
critical environments and helps DBAs during the recovery phase.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATIONS
.PP
The system\-level Barman configuration file is located at
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and is overridden on a per\-user level by
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$HOME/.barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
.PP
The Barman configuration file is a plain \f[C]INI\f[] file.
There is a general section called \f[C][barman]\f[] and a section
\f[C][servername]\f[] for each server you want to backup.
Rows starting with \f[C];\f[] are comments.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTORY
.PP
Barman supports the inclusion of multiple configuration files, through
the \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] option.
Included files must contain only server specifications, not global
configurations.
If the value of \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] is a directory,
Barman reads all files with \f[C]\&.conf\f[] extension that exist in
that folder.
For example, if you set it to \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[], you can specify
your PostgreSQL servers placing each section in a separate
\f[C]\&.conf\f[] file inside the \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[] folder.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B active
When set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), the server is in full operational
state.
When set to \f[C]false\f[], the server can be used for diagnostics, but
any operational command such as backup execution or WAL archiving is
temporarily disabled.
When adding a new server to Barman, we suggest setting active=false at
first, making sure that barman check shows no problems, and only then
activating the server.
This will avoid spamming the Barman logs with errors during the initial
setup.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver
This option allows you to activate log file shipping through
PostgreSQL\[aq]s \f[C]archive_command\f[] for a server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), Barman expects that continuous
archiving for a server is in place and will activate checks as well as
management (including compression) of WAL files that Postgres deposits
in the \f[I]incoming\f[] directory.
Setting it to \f[C]false\f[], will disable standard continuous archiving
for a server.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver_batch_size
This option allows you to activate batch processing of WAL files for the
\f[C]archiver\f[] process, by setting it to a value > 0.
Otherwise, the traditional unlimited processing of the WAL queue is
enabled.
When batch processing is activated, the \f[C]archive\-wal\f[] process
would limit itself to maximum \f[C]archiver_batch_size\f[] WAL segments
per single run.
Integer.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression
The compression to be used during the backup process.
Only supported when \f[C]backup_method\ =\ postgres\f[].
Can either be unset or \f[C]gzip\f[],\f[C]lz4\f[] or \f[C]zstd\f[].
If unset then no compression will be used during the backup.
Use of this option requires that the CLI application for the specified
compression algorithm is available on the Barman server (at backup time)
and the PostgreSQL server (at recovery time).
Note that the \f[C]lz4\f[] and \f[C]zstd\f[] algorithms require
PostgreSQL 15 (beta) or later.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_format
The format pg_basebackup should use when writing compressed backups to
disk.
Can be set to either \f[C]plain\f[] or \f[C]tar\f[].
If unset then a default of \f[C]tar\f[] is assumed.
The value \f[C]plain\f[] can only be used if the server is running
PostgreSQL 15 or later \f[I]and\f[] if
\f[C]backup_compression_location\f[] is \f[C]server\f[].
Only supported when \f[C]backup_method\ =\ postgres\f[].
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_level
An integer value representing the compression level to use when
compressing backups.
Allowed values depend on the compression algorithm specified by
\f[C]backup_compression\f[].
Only supported when \f[C]backup_method\ =\ postgres\f[].
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_location
The location (either \f[C]client\f[] or \f[C]server\f[]) where
compression should be performed during the backup.
The value \f[C]server\f[] is only allowed if the server is running
PostgreSQL 15 or later.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_workers
The number of compression threads to be used during the backup process.
Only supported when \f[C]backup_compression\ =\ zstd\f[] is set.
Default value is 0.
In this case default compression behavior will be used.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_directory
Directory where backup data for a server will be placed.
Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_method
Configure the method barman used for backup execution.
If set to \f[C]rsync\f[] (default), barman will execute backup using the
\f[C]rsync\f[] command over SSH (requires \f[C]ssh_command\f[]).
If set to \f[C]postgres\f[] barman will use the \f[C]pg_basebackup\f[]
command to execute the backup.
If set to \f[C]local\-rsync\f[], barman will assume to be running on the
same server as the PostgreSQL instance and with the same user, then
execute \f[C]rsync\f[] for the file system copy.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_options
This option allows you to control the way Barman interacts with
PostgreSQL for backups.
It is a comma\-separated list of values that accepts the following
options:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]concurrent_backup\f[] (default): \f[C]barman\ backup\f[] executes
backup operations using concurrent backup which is the recommended
backup approach for PostgreSQL versions >= 9.6 and uses the PostgreSQL
API.
If using PostgreSQL 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, or 9.5, Barman requires the
\f[C]pgespresso\f[] module to be installed on the PostgreSQL server.
\f[C]concurrent_backup\f[] can also be used to perform a backup from a
standby server.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]exclusive_backup\f[] (PostgreSQL versions older than 15 only):
\f[C]barman\ backup\f[] executes backup operations using the deprecated
exclusive backup approach (technically through \f[C]pg_start_backup\f[]
and \f[C]pg_stop_backup\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]external_configuration\f[]: if present, any warning regarding
external configuration files is suppressed during the execution of a
backup.
.PP
Note that \f[C]exclusive_backup\f[] and \f[C]concurrent_backup\f[] are
mutually exclusive.

Customised compression magic which is checked in the beginning of a WAL
file to select the custom algorithm.
If you are using a custom compression filter then setting this will
prevent barman from applying the custom compression to WALs which have
been pre\-compressed with that compression.
If you do not configure this then custom compression will still be
applied but any pre\-compressed WAL files will be compressed again
during WAL archive.

.RE
.TP
.B forward_config_path
Parameter which determines whether a passive node should forward its
configuration file path to its primary node during cron or sync\-info
commands.
Set to true if you are invoking barman with the \f[C]\-c/\-\-config\f[]
option and your configuration is in the same place on both the passive

Defaults to false.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B immediate_checkpoint
This option allows you to control the way PostgreSQL handles checkpoint
at the start of the backup.
If set to \f[C]false\f[] (default), the I/O workload for the checkpoint
will be limited, according to the \f[C]checkpoint_completion_target\f[]
setting on the PostgreSQL server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[], an immediate checkpoint will be requested,
meaning that PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as
possible.

Syntax for this option is: "i (DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS)" where i is a
integer greater than zero, representing the number of days | weeks |
months of the time frame.

k=kilo=1000, Ki=Kibi=1024 and so forth.
