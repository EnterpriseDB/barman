.SH NAME
.PP
barman \- Backup and Recovery Manager for PostgreSQL
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Barman is an administration tool for disaster recovery of PostgreSQL
servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
Barman can perform remote backups of multiple servers in business
critical environments and helps DBAs during the recovery phase.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATIONS
.PP
The system\-level Barman configuration file is located at
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and is overridden on a per\-user level by
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$HOME/.barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
.PP
The Barman configuration file is a plain \f[C]INI\f[] file.
There is a general section called \f[C][barman]\f[] and a section
\f[C][servername]\f[] for each server you want to backup.
Rows starting with \f[C];\f[] are comments.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTORY
.PP
Barman supports the inclusion of multiple configuration files, through
the \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] option.
Included files must contain only server specifications, not global
configurations.
If the value of \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] is a directory,
Barman reads all files with \f[C]\&.conf\f[] extension that exist in
that folder.
For example, if you set it to \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[], you can specify
your PostgreSQL servers placing each section in a separate
\f[C]\&.conf\f[] file inside the \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[] folder.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B active
When set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), the server is in full operational
state.
When set to \f[C]false\f[], the server can be used for diagnostics, but
any operational command such as backup execution or WAL archiving is
temporarily disabled.
When adding a new server to Barman, we suggest setting active=false at
first, making sure that barman check shows no problems, and only then
activating the server.
This will avoid spamming the Barman logs with errors during the initial
setup.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver
This option allows you to activate log file shipping through
PostgreSQL\[aq]s \f[C]archive_command\f[] for a server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), Barman expects that continuous
archiving for a server is in place and will activate checks as well as
management (including compression) of WAL files that Postgres deposits
in the \f[I]incoming\f[] directory.
Setting it to \f[C]false\f[], will disable standard continuous archiving
for a server.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver_batch_size
This option allows you to activate batch processing of WAL files for the
\f[C]archiver\f[] process, by setting it to a value > 0.
Otherwise, the traditional unlimited processing of the WAL queue is
enabled.
When batch processing is activated, the \f[C]archive\-wal\f[] process
would limit itself to maximum \f[C]archiver_batch_size\f[] WAL segments
per single run.
Integer.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B autogenerate_manifest
This option enables the auto\-generation of backup manifest files for
rsync based backups and strategies.
The manifest file is a JSON file containing the list of files contained
in the backup.
It is generated at the end of the backup process and stored in the
backup directory.
The manifest file generated follows the format described in the
postgesql documentation, and is compatible with the
\f[C]pg_verifybackup\f[] tool.
The option is ignored if the backup method is not rsync.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B aws_profile
The name of the AWS profile to use when authenticating with AWS (e.g.
INI section in AWS credentials file).
Global/Server.
aws_region

defined by \f[C]snapshot_instance\f[] and \f[C]snapshot_disks\f[].

.RS
.RE
.TP
.B azure_credential
The credential type (either \f[C]azure\-cli\f[] or

If this is omitted then the default Azure authentication flow will be
used.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE

.B azure_resource_group
The name of the Azure resource group to which the compute instance and
disks defined by \f[C]snapshot_instance\f[] and \f[C]snapshot_disks\f[]
belong.
Global/Server.
Required when the \f[C]snapshot\f[] value is specified for
\f[C]backup_method\f[] and \f[C]snapshot_provider\f[] is set to
\f[C]azure\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B azure_subscription_id

volumes defined by \f[C]snapshot_instance\f[] and
\f[C]snapshot_disks\f[].
Global/Server.

.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression
The compression to be used during the backup process.
Only supported when \f[C]backup_method\ =\ postgres\f[].
Can either be unset or \f[C]gzip\f[],\f[C]lz4\f[] or \f[C]zstd\f[].
If unset then no compression will be used during the backup.
Use of this option requires that the CLI application for the specified
compression algorithm is available on the Barman server (at backup time)
and the PostgreSQL server (at recovery time).
Note that the \f[C]lz4\f[] and \f[C]zstd\f[] algorithms require
PostgreSQL 15 (beta) or later.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_format
The format pg_basebackup should use when writing compressed backups to
disk.
Can be set to either \f[C]plain\f[] or \f[C]tar\f[].
If unset then a default of \f[C]tar\f[] is assumed.
The value \f[C]plain\f[] can only be used if the server is running
PostgreSQL 15 or later \f[I]and\f[] if
\f[C]backup_compression_location\f[] is \f[C]server\f[].
Only supported when \f[C]backup_method\ =\ postgres\f[].

.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_level

.RE
.TP
.B backup_compression_location

.RE
.TP
.B backup_method
Configure the method barman used for backup execution.
If set to \f[C]rsync\f[] (default), barman will execute backup using the
\f[C]rsync\f[] command over SSH (requires \f[C]ssh_command\f[]).
If set to \f[C]postgres\f[] barman will use the \f[C]pg_basebackup\f[]
command to execute the backup.
If set to \f[C]local\-rsync\f[], barman will assume to be running on the
same server as the PostgreSQL instance and with the same user, then
execute \f[C]rsync\f[] for the file system copy.
If set to \f[C]snapshot\f[], barman will use the API for the cloud
provider defined in the \f[C]snapshot_provider\f[] option to create
snapshots of disks specified in the \f[C]snapshot_disks\f[] option and
save only the backup label and metadata to its own storage.

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]concurrent_backup\f[] (default): \f[C]barman\ backup\f[] executes
backup operations using concurrent backup which is the recommended
backup approach for PostgreSQL versions >= 9.6 and uses the PostgreSQL

.RS
.RE
.TP
.B streaming_archiver
This option allows you to use the PostgreSQL\[aq]s streaming protocol to
receive transaction logs from a server.
If set to \f[C]on\f[], Barman expects to find \f[C]pg_receivewal\f[]
(known as \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[] prior to PostgreSQL 10) in the PATH
(see \f[C]path_prefix\f[] option) and that streaming connection for the
server is working.
This activates connection checks as well as management (including
compression) of WAL files.
If set to \f[C]off\f[] (default) barman will rely only on continuous
archiving for a server WAL archive operations, eventually terminating
any running \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[] for the server.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B streaming_archiver_batch_size
This option allows you to activate batch processing of WAL files for the
\f[C]streaming_archiver\f[] process, by setting it to a value > 0.
Otherwise, the traditional unlimited processing of the WAL queue is
enabled.
When batch processing is activated, the \f[C]archive\-wal\f[] process
would limit itself to maximum \f[C]streaming_archiver_batch_size\f[] WAL
segments per single run.
