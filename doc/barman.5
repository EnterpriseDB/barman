.SH NAME
.PP
barman \- Backup and Recovery Manager for PostgreSQL
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Barman is an administration tool for disaster recovery of PostgreSQL
servers written in Python and maintained by 2ndQuadrant.
Barman can perform remote backups of multiple servers in business
critical environments and helps DBAs during the recovery phase.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATIONS
.PP
The system\-level Barman configuration file is located at
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and is overridden on a per\-user level by
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$HOME/.barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
.PP
The Barman configuration file is a plain \f[C]INI\f[] file.
There is a general section called \f[C][barman]\f[] and a section
\f[C][servername]\f[] for each server you want to backup.
Rows starting with \f[C];\f[] are comments.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTORY
.PP
Barman supports the inclusion of multiple configuration files, through
the \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] option.
Included files must contain only server specifications, not global
configurations.
If the value of \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] is a directory,
Barman reads all files with \f[C]\&.conf\f[] extension that exist in
that folder.
For example, if you set it to \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[], you can specify
your PostgreSQL servers placing each section in a separate
\f[C]\&.conf\f[] file inside the \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[] folder.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B active
When set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), the server is in full operational
state.
When set to \f[C]false\f[], the server can be used for diagnostics, but
any operational command such as backup execution or WAL archiving is
temporarily disabled.
Setting \f[C]active=false\f[] is a good practice when adding a new node
to Barman.
Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver
This option allows you to activate log file shipping through
PostgreSQL\[aq]s \f[C]archive_command\f[] for a server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), Barman expects that continuous
archiving for a server is in place and will activate checks as well as
management (including compression) of WAL files that Postgres deposits
in the \f[I]incoming\f[] directory.
Setting it to \f[C]false\f[], will disable standard continuous archiving
for a server.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver_batch_size
This option allows you to activate batch processing of WAL files for the
\f[C]archiver\f[] process, by setting it to a value > 0.
Otherwise, the traditional unlimited processing of the WAL queue is
enabled.
When batch processing is activated, the \f[C]archive\-wal\f[] process
would limit itself to maximum \f[C]archiver_batch_size\f[] WAL segments
per single run.
Integer.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_directory
Directory where backup data for a server will be placed.
Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_method
Configure the method barman used for backup execution.
If set to \f[C]rsync\f[] (default), barman will execute backup using the
\f[C]rsync\f[] command.
If set to \f[C]postgres\f[] barman will use the \f[C]pg_basebackup\f[]
command to execute the backup.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_options
This option allows you to control the way Barman interacts with
PostgreSQL for backups.
It is a comma\-separated list of values that accepts the following
options:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]exclusive_backup\f[] (default when
\f[C]backup_method\ =\ rsync\f[]): \f[C]barman\ backup\f[] executes
backup operations using the standard exclusive backup approach
(technically through \f[C]pg_start_backup\f[] and
\f[C]pg_stop_backup\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]concurrent_backup\f[] (default when
\f[C]backup_method\ =\ postgres\f[]): if using PostgreSQL 9.2, 9.3, 9.4,
and 9.5, Barman requires the \f[C]pgespresso\f[] module to be installed
on the PostgreSQL server and can be used to perform a backup from a
standby server.
Starting from PostgreSQL 9.6, Barman uses the new PostgreSQL API to
perform backups from a standby server.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]external_configuration\f[]: if present, any warning regarding
external configuration files is suppressed during the execution of a
backup.
.PP
Note that \f[C]exclusive_backup\f[] and \f[C]concurrent_backup\f[] are
mutually exclusive.

related to a conflict with an existing WAL file (e.g.
a WAL file that has been archived after a streamed one).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B immediate_checkpoint
This option allows you to control the way PostgreSQL handles checkpoint
at the start of the backup.
If set to \f[C]false\f[] (default), the I/O workload for the checkpoint
will be limited, according to the \f[C]checkpoint_completion_target\f[]
setting on the PostgreSQL server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[], an immediate checkpoint will be requested,
meaning that PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as
possible.

.TP
.B last_backup_maximum_age
This option identifies a time frame that must contain the latest backup.
If the latest backup is older than the time frame, barman check command
will report an error to the user.
If empty (default), latest backup is always considered valid.
Syntax for this option is: "i (DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS)" where i is a
integer greater than zero, representing the number of days | weeks |
months of the time frame.

.B streaming_archiver
This option allows you to use the PostgreSQL\[aq]s streaming protocol to
receive transaction logs from a server.
If set to \f[C]on\f[], Barman expects to find \f[C]pg_receivewal\f[]
(known as \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[] prior to PostgreSQL 10) in the PATH
(see \f[C]path_prefix\f[] option) and that streaming connection for the
server is working.
This activates connection checks as well as management (including
compression) of WAL files.
If set to \f[C]off\f[] (default) barman will rely only on continuous
archiving for a server WAL archive operations, eventually terminating
any running \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[] for the server.
