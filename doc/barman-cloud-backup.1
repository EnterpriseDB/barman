.SH NAME
.PP
barman\-cloud\-backup \- Backup a PostgreSQL instance and stores it in
the Cloud
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
barman\-cloud\-backup [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[]] \f[I]DESTINATION_URL\f[]
\f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script can be used to perform a backup of a local PostgreSQL
instance and ship the resulting tarball(s) to the Cloud.
Currently AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage are
supported.
.PP
It requires read access to PGDATA and tablespaces (normally run as
\f[C]postgres\f[] user).
It can also be used as a hook script on a barman server, in which case
it requires read access to the directory where barman backups are
stored.
.PP
This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery of
PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT:\f[] the Cloud upload process may fail if any file with a
size greater than the configured \f[C]\-\-max\-archive\-size\f[] is
present either in the data directory or in any tablespaces.
However, PostgreSQL creates files with a maximum size of 1GB, and that
size is always allowed, regardless of the \f[C]max\-archive\-size\f[]
parameter.
.SH POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B DESTINATION_URL
URL of the cloud destination, such as a bucket in AWS S3.
For example: \f[C]s3://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/folder\f[] (where
\f[C]BUCKET_NAME\f[] is the bucket you have created in AWS).

This script can be used in conjunction with \f[C]post_backup_script\f[]
or \f[C]post_backup_retry_script\f[] to relay barman backups to cloud
storage as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
post_backup_retry_script\ =\ \[aq]barman\-cloud\-backup\ [*OPTIONS*]\ *DESTINATION_URL*\ ${BARMAN_SERVER}\[aq]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
When running as a hook script, barman\-cloud\-backup will read the
location of the backup directory and the backup ID from BACKUP_DIR and
BACKUP_ID environment variables set by barman.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Barman has been extensively tested, and is currently being used in
several production environments.
However, we cannot exclude the presence of bugs.
.PP
Any bug can be reported via the GitHub issue tracker.
