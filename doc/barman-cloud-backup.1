.SH NAME
.PP
barman-cloud-backup - Backup a PostgreSQL instance and stores it in the
Cloud
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
barman-cloud-backup [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] \f[I]DESTINATION_URL\f[R]
\f[I]SERVER_NAME\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script can be used to perform a backup of a local PostgreSQL
instance and ship the resulting tarball(s) to the Cloud.
Currently AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage are supported.
.PP
It requires read access to PGDATA and tablespaces (normally run as
\f[C]postgres\f[R] user).
It can also be used as a hook script on a barman server, in which case
it requires read access to the directory where barman backups are
stored.
.PP
This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery of
PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT:\f[R] the Cloud upload process may fail if any file with
a size greater than the configured \f[C]--max-archive-size\f[R] is
present either in the data directory or in any tablespaces.
However, PostgreSQL creates files with a maximum size of 1GB, and that
size is always allowed, regardless of the \f[C]max-archive-size\f[R]
parameter.
.SH POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

.SH SEE ALSO
.PP
This script can be used in conjunction with \f[C]post_backup_script\f[R]
or \f[C]post_backup_retry_script\f[R] to relay barman backups to cloud
storage as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
post_backup_retry_script = \[aq]barman-cloud-backup [*OPTIONS*] *DESTINATION_URL* ${BARMAN_SERVER}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When running as a hook script, barman-cloud-backup will read the
location of the backup directory and the backup ID from BACKUP_DIR and
BACKUP_ID environment variables set by barman.
