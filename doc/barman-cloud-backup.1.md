# NAME

barman-cloud-backup - Backup a PostgreSQL instance and stores it in the Cloud


# SYNOPSIS

barman-cloud-backup [*OPTIONS*] *DESTINATION_URL* *SERVER_NAME*


# DESCRIPTION

This script can be used to perform a backup of a local PostgreSQL instance
and ship the resulting tarball(s) to the Cloud. It requires read access
to PGDATA and tablespaces (normally run as `postgres` user).
Currently only AWS S3 is supported.

This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery
of PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by 2ndQuadrant.

**IMPORTANT:** the Cloud upload process may fail if any file with a
size greater than the configured `--max-archive-size` is present
either in the data directory or in any tablespaces.
However, PostgreSQL creates files with a maximum size of 1GB,
and that size is always allowed, regardless of the `max-archive-size`
parameter.
