# NAME

barman-cloud-backup - Backup a PostgreSQL instance and stores it in the Cloud


# SYNOPSIS

barman-cloud-backup [*OPTIONS*] *DESTINATION_URL* *SERVER_NAME*


# DESCRIPTION

This script can be used to perform a backup of a local PostgreSQL instance
and ship the resulting tarball(s) to the Cloud. Currently AWS S3, Azure
Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage are supported.

It requires read access to PGDATA and tablespaces (normally run as `postgres`
user). It can also be used as a hook script on a barman server, in which
case it requires read access to the directory where barman backups are stored.

If the arguments prefixed with `--snapshot-` are used, and snapshots are
supported for the selected cloud provider, then the backup will be performed
using snapshots of the disks specified using `--snapshot-disk` arguments. The
backup label and backup metadata will be uploaded to the cloud object store.

This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery
of PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.

**IMPORTANT:** the Cloud upload process may fail if any file with a
size greater than the configured `--max-archive-size` is present
either in the data directory or in any tablespaces.
However, PostgreSQL creates files with a maximum size of 1GB,
and that size is always allowed, regardless of the `max-archive-size`
parameter.

# DEPENDENCIES

If using `--cloud-provider=aws-s3`:

* boto3

If using `--cloud-provider=azure-blob-storage`:

* azure-storage-blob
* azure-identity (optional, if you wish to use DefaultAzureCredential)

# EXIT STATUS

0
:   Success

Other non-zero codes

# SEE ALSO

This script can be used in conjunction with `post_backup_script` or
`post_backup_retry_script` to relay barman backups to cloud storage as follows:

```
post_backup_retry_script = 'barman-cloud-backup [*OPTIONS*] *DESTINATION_URL* ${BARMAN_SERVER}'
```

When running as a hook script, barman-cloud-backup will read the location of
the backup directory and the backup ID from BACKUP_DIR and BACKUP_ID environment
variables set by barman.


# BUGS

Barman has been extensively tested, and is currently being used in several
production environments. However, we cannot exclude the presence of bugs.

Any bug can be reported via the GitHub issue tracker.
