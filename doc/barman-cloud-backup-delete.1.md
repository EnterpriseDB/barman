# NAME

barman-cloud-backup-delete - Delete backups stored in the Cloud


# SYNOPSIS

barman-cloud-backup-delete [*OPTIONS*] *SOURCE_URL* *SERVER_NAME*


# DESCRIPTION

This script can be used to delete backups previously made with the
`barman-cloud-backup` command. Currently AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage
are supported.

The target backups can be specified either using the backup ID (as
returned by barman-cloud-backup-list) or by retention policy. Retention
policies are the same as those for Barman server and work as described in
the Barman manual: all backups not required to meet the specified policy
will be deleted.

When a backup is succesfully deleted any unused WALs associated with that
backup are removed. WALs are only considered unused if:

 1. There are no older backups than the deleted backup *or* all older backups
    are archival backups.
 2. The WALs pre-date the begin_wal value of the oldest remaining backup.
 3. The WALs are not required by any archival backups present in cloud storage.

Note: The deletion of each backup involves three separate delete requests
to the cloud provider (once for the backup files, once for the backup.info
file and once for any associated WALs). If you have a significant number of
backups accumulated in cloud storage then deleting by retention policy could
result in a large number of delete requests.

This script and Barman are administration tools for disaster recovery
of PostgreSQL servers written in Python and maintained by EnterpriseDB.


# POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

SOURCE_URL
:    URL of the cloud source, such as a bucket in AWS S3.
     For example: `s3://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/folder` (where `BUCKET_NAME`
     is the bucket you have created in AWS).

SERVER_NAME
:    the name of the server as configured in Barman.

-q, --quiet

     about the objects which would be deleted to stdout
