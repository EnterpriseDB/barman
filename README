              Backup and Recovery Manager for PostgreSQL Tutorial

   Barman (backup and recovery manager) is an administration tool for
   disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers written in Python. Barman can
   perform remote backups of multiple servers in business critical
   environments, and helps DBAs during the recovery phase.

   Barman’s most wanted features include: backup catalogues, retention
   policies, remote recovery, archiving and compression of WAL files and
   of backups. Barman is written and maintained by PostgreSQL
   professionals 2ndQuadrant.
     __________________________________________________________________

Introduction

   In a perfect world, there would be no need for a backup. However it is
   important, especially in business environments, to be prepared for when
   the "unexpected" happens. In a database scenario, the unexpected could
   take any of the following forms:
     * data corruption;
     * system failure, including hardware failure;
     * human error;
     * natural disaster.

   In such cases, any ICT manager or DBA should be able to repair the
   incident and recover the database in the shortest possible time. We
   normally refer to this discipline as Disaster recovery.

   This guide assumes that you are familiar with theoretical disaster
   recovery concepts, and you have a grasp of PostgreSQL fundamentals in
   terms of physical backup and disaster recovery. If not, we encourage
   you to read the PostgreSQL documentation or any of the recommended
   books on PostgreSQL.

   Professional training on this topic is another effective way of
   learning these concepts. At any time of the year you can find many
   courses available all over the world, delivered by PostgreSQL companies
   such as 2ndQuadrant.

   For now, you should be aware that any PostgreSQL physical/binary backup
   (not to be confused with the logical backups produced by the pg_dump
   utility) is composed of:
     * a base backup;
     * one or more WAL files (usually collected through continuous
       archiving).

   PostgreSQL offers the core primitives that allow DBAs to setup a really
   robust Disaster Recovery environment. However, it becomes complicated
   to manage multiple backups, from one or more PostgreSQL servers.
   Restoring a given backup is another task that any PostgreSQL DBA would
   love to see more automated and user friendly.

   With these goals in mind, 2ndQuadrant started the development of Barman
   for PostgreSQL. Barman is an acronym for "Backup and Recovery Manager".
   Currently Barman works only on Linux and Unix operating systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

Before you start

   The first step is to decide the architecture of your backup. In a
   simple scenario, you have one PostgreSQL instance (server) running on a
   host. You want your data continuously backed up to another server,
   called the backup server.

   Barman allows you to launch PostgreSQL backups directly from the backup
   server, using SSH connections. Furthermore, it allows you to centralise
   your backups in case you have more than one PostgreSQL server to
   manage.

   During this guide, we will assume that:
     * there is one PostgreSQL instance on a host (called pg for
       simplicity)
     * there is one backup server on another host (called backup)
     * communication via SSH between the two servers is enabled
     * the PostgreSQL server can be reached from the backup server as the
       postgres operating system user (or another user with PostgreSQL
       database superuser privileges, typically configured via ident
       authentication)

   It is important to note that, for disaster recovery, these two servers
   must not share any physical resource except for the network. You can
   use Barman in geographical redundancy scenarios for better disaster
   recovery outcomes.

  System requirements

     * Linux/Unix
     * Python 2.6 or 2.7
     * Python modules:
          + argcomplete
          + argh >= 0.21.2
          + psycopg2
          + python-dateutil < 2.0 (since version 2.0 requires python3)
          + distribute (optional)
     * PostgreSQL >= 8.3
     * rsync >= 3.0.4

   Important
            The same major version of PostgreSQL should be installed on both
            servers.

   Tip
      Users of RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Scientific Linux are
      advised to install the Extra Packages Enterprise Linux (EPEL)
      repository.
      [Further information at [1]http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL]

   Note
       Version 1.2.3 of Barman has been refactored for Python 3 support.
       Please consider it as experimental now and report any bug through the
       ticketing system on SourceForge or mailing list.
     __________________________________________________________________

Installation

  On RedHat/CentOS using RPM packages

   Barman can be installed on RHEL5 and RHEL6 Linux systems using RPM
   packages.

   Barman is available through the PostgreSQL Global Development Group RPM
   repository with Yum. You need to follow the instructions for your
   distribution (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) and architecture that you
   can find at [2]http://yum.postgresql.org/.

   Then, as root simply type:

     yum install barman

  On Debian/Ubuntu using packages

   Barman can be installed on Debian and Ubuntu Linux systems using
   packages.

   It is available in the official repository for Debian Sid (unstable)
   and Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal).

   Note
       You can install an up-to-date version of Barman on many Debian and
       Ubuntu releases using the PostgreSQL Community APT repository at
       [3]http://apt.postgresql.org/. Instructions can be found at
       [4]https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt.

   Installing Barman is as simple as typing as root user:

     apt-get install barman

  From sources

   Create a system user called barman on the backup server. As barman
   user, download the sources and uncompress them.

   For a system-wide installation, type:

  barman@backup$ ./setup.py build
  barman@backup# ./setup.py install # run this command with root privileges or s
udo

   For a local installation, type:

     barman@backup$ ./setup.py install --user

   Important
            The --user option works only with python-distribute

   barman will be installed in your user directory (make sure that your
   PATH environment variable is set properly).
     __________________________________________________________________

Getting started

  Prerequisites

    SSH connection

   Barman needs a bidirectional SSH connection between the barman user on
   the backup server and the postgres user. SSH must be configured such
   that there is no password prompt presented when connecting. on the pg
   server. As the barman user on the backup server, generate an SSH key
   with an empty password, and append the public key to the
   authorized_keys file of the postgres user on the pg server.

   The barman user on the backup server should then be able to perform the
   following operation without typing a password:

     barman@backup$ ssh postgres@pg

   The procedure must be repeated with sides swapped in order to allow the
   postgres user on the pg server to connect to the backup server as the
   barman user without typing a password:

     postgres@pg$ ssh barman@backup

   For further information, refer to OpenSSH documentation.

    PostgreSQL connection

   You need to make sure that the backup server allows connection to the
   PostgreSQL server on pg as superuser (postgres).

   You can choose your favourite client authentication method among those
   offered by PostgreSQL. More information can be found here:
   [5]http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/client-authentication.
   html

     barman@backup$ psql -c 'SELECT version()' -U postgres -h pg

   Note
       As of version 1.1.2, Barman honours the application_name connection
       option for PostgreSQL servers 9.0 or higher.

    Backup directory

   Barman needs a main backup directory to store all the backups. Even
   though you can define a separate folder for each server you want to
   back up and for each type of resource (backup or WAL segments, for
   instance), we suggest that you adhere to the default rules and stick
   with the conventions that Barman chooses for you.

   You will see that the configuration file (as explained below) defines a
   barman_home variable, which is the directory where Barman will store
   all your backups by default. We choose /var/lib/barman as home
   directory for Barman:

     barman@backup$ sudo mkdir /var/lib/barman
     barman@backup$ sudo chown barman:barman /var/lib/barman

Important
         We assume that you have enough space, and that you have already thought
         about redundancy and safety of your disks.

  Basic configuration

   In the docs directory you will find a minimal configuration file. Use
   it as a template, and copy it to /etc/barman.conf, or to
   ~/.barman.conf. In general, the former applies to all the users on the
   backup server, while the latter applies only to the barman user; for
   the purpose of this tutorial there is no difference in using one or the
   other.

   From version 1.2.1, you can use /etc/barman/barman.conf as default
   system configuration file.

   The configuration file follows the standard INI format, and is split
   in:
     * a section for general configuration (identified by the barman
       label)
     * a section for each PostgreSQL server to be backed up (identified by
       the server label, e.g. main or pg)
       [all and barman are reserved words and cannot be used as server
       labels]

   As of version 1.1.2, you can now specify a directory for configuration
   files similarly to other Linux applications, using the
   configuration_files_directory option (empty by default). If the value
   of configuration_files_directory is a directory, Barman will read all
   the files with .conf extension that exist in that folder. For example,
   if you set it to /etc/barman.d, you can specify your PostgreSQL servers
   placing each section in a separate .conf file inside the /etc/barman.d
   folder.

   Otherwise, you can use Barman’s standard way of specifying sections
   within the main configuration file.

   You can now test the configuration by executing:

     barman@backup$ barman show-server main
     barman@backup$ barman check main

   Write down the incoming_wals_directory, as printed by the barman
   show-server main command, because you will need it to setup continuous
   WAL archiving.

Important
         The barman check main command automatically creates all the directories
         for the continuous backup of the main server.

    Continuous WAL archiving

   Edit the postgresql.conf file of the PostgreSQL instance on the pg
   database and activate the archive mode:

     wal_level = 'archive' # For PostgreSQL >= 9.0
     archive_mode = on
     archive_command = 'rsync -a %p barman@backup:INCOMING_WALS_DIRECTORY/%f'

   Make sure you change the INCOMING_WALS_DIRECTORY placeholder with the
   value returned by the barman show-server main command above.

   In case you use Hot Standby, wal_level must be set to hot_standby.

   Restart the PostgreSQL server.

   In order to test that continuous archiving is on and properly working,
   you need to check both the PostgreSQL server
   [For more information, refer to the PostgreSQL documentation]
   and the backup server (in particular, that the WAL files are collected
   in the destination directory).

  Listing the servers

   The following command displays the list of all the available servers:

     barman@backup$ barman list-server

  Executing a full backup

   To take a backup for the main server, issue the following command:

     barman@backup$ barman backup main

   As of version 1.1.0, you can serialise the backup of your managed
   servers by using the all target for the server:

     barman@backup$ barman backup all

   This will iterate through your available servers and sequentially take
   a backup for each of them.

    Immediate Checkpoint

   As of version 1.3.0, it is possible to use the immediate_checkpoint
   configuration global/server option (set to false by default).

   When issuing a backup, Barman normally waits for the checkpoint to
   happen on the PostgreSQL server (depending on the configuration
   settings for workload or time checkpoint control). This might take
   longer for a backup to start.

   By setting immediate_checkpoint to true, you can force the checkpoint
   on the Postgres server to happen immediately and start your backup copy
   process as soon as possible:

   At any time, you can override the configuration option behaviour, by
   issuing barman backup with any of these two options:
     * --immediate-checkpoint, which forces an immediate checkpoint;
     * --no-immediate-checkpoint, which forces to wait for the checkpoint
       to happen.

  Viewing the list of backups for a server

   To list all the available backups for a given server, issue:

     barman@backup$ barman list-backup main

   the format of the output is as in:

  main - 20120529T092136 - Wed May 30 15:20:25 2012 - Size: 5.0 TiB - WAL Size:
845.0 GiB (tablespaces: tb_name:/home/tblspace/name, tb_temp:/home/tblspace/temp
)

   where 20120529T092136 is the ID of the backup and Wed May 30 15:20:25
   2012 is the start time of the operation, Size is the size of the base
   backup and WAL Size is the size of WAL files archived.

   As of version 1.1.2, you can get a listing of the available backups for
   all your servers, using the all target for the server:

     barman@backup$ barman list-backup all

  Restoring a whole server

   To restore a whole server issue the following command:

   barman@backup$ barman recover main 20110920T185953 /path/to/recover/directory

   where 20110920T185953 is the ID of the backup to be restored. When this
   command completes succesfully, /path/to/recover/directory contains a
   complete data directory ready to be started as a PostgreSQL database
   server.

   Here is an example of a command that starts the server:

     barman@backup$ pg_ctl -D /path/to/recover/directory start

   Important
            If you run this command as user barman, it will become the database
            superuser.

   You can retrieve a list of backup IDs for a specific server with:

     barman@backup$ barman list-backup srvpgsql

 Important
          Barman does not currently keep track of symbolic links inside PGDATA
          (except for tablespaces inside pg_tblspc). We encourage system
          administrators to keep track of symbolic links and to add them to the
          disaster recovery plans/procedures in case they need to be restored in
          their original location.

  Remote recovery

   Barman is able to recover a backup on a remote server through the
   --remote-ssh-command COMMAND option for the recover command.

   If this option is specified, barman uses COMMAND to connect to a remote
   host.

   Note
       The postgres user is normally used to recover on a remote host.

   There are some limitations when using remote recovery. It is important
   to be aware that:
     * Barman needs at least 4GB of free space in the system temporary
       directory (usually /tmp);
     * the SSH connection between Barman and the remote host must use
       public key exchange authentication method;
     * the remote user must be able to create the required destination
       directories for PGDATA and, where applicable, tablespaces;
     * there must be enough free space on the remote server to contain the
       base backup and the WAL files needed for recovery.

  Relocating one or more tablespaces

 Important
          As of version 1.3.0, it is possible to relocate a tablespace both with
          local and remote recovery.

   Barman is able to automatically relocate one or more tablespaces using
   the recover command with the --tablespace option. The option accepts a
   pair of values as arguments using the NAME:DIRECTORY format:
     * name/identifier of the tablespace (NAME);
     * destination directory (DIRECTORY).

   If the destination directory does not exists, Barman will try to create
   it (assuming you have enough privileges).

  Restoring to a given point in time

   Barman employs PostgreSQL’s Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) by allowing
   DBAs to specify a recovery target, either as a timestamp or as a
   transaction ID; you can also specify whether the recovery target should
   be included or not in the recovery.

   The recovery target can be specified using one of three mutually
   exclusive options:
     * --target-time TARGET_TIME: to specify a timestamp
     * --target-xid TARGET_XID: to specify a transaction ID
     * --target-name TARGET_NAME: to specify a named restore point -
       previously created with the pg_create_restore_point(name) function
       [Only available for PostgreSQL 9.1 and above users]

   You can use the --exclusive option to specify whether to stop
   immediately before or immediately after the recovery target.

   Barman allows you to specify a target timeline for recovery, using the
   target-tli option. The notion of timeline goes beyond the scope of this
   document; you can find more details in the PostgreSQL documentation, or
   in one of 2ndQuadrant’s Recovery training courses.

  Retry of copy in backup/recovery operations

   As of version 1.3.3, it is possible to take advantage of two new
   options in Barman:
     * basebackup_retry_times (set to 0 by default)
     * basebackup_retry_sleep (set to 30 by default)

   When issuing a backup or a recovery, Barman normally tries to copy the
   base backup once. If the copy fails (e.g. due to network problems),
   Barman terminates the operation with a failure.

   By setting basebackup_retry_times, Barman will try to re-execute a copy
   operation as many times as requested by the user. The
   basebackup_retry_sleep option specifies the number of seconds that
   Barman will wait between each attempt.

   At any time you can override the configuration option behaviour from
   the command line, when issuing barman backup or barman recover, using:
     * --retry-times <retry_number> (same logic as basebackup_retry_times)
     * --no-retry (same as --retry-times 0)
     * --retry-sleep <number_of_seconds> (same logic as
       basebackup_retry_sleep)
     __________________________________________________________________

WAL compression

   The barman cron command (see below) will compress WAL files if the
   compression option is set in the configuration file. This option allows
   three values:
     * gzip: for Gzip compression (requires gzip)
     * bzip2: for Bzip2 compression (requires bzip2)
     * custom: for custom compression, which requires you to set the
       following options as well:
          + custom_compression_filter: a compression filter
          + custom_decompression_filter: a decompression filter
     __________________________________________________________________

Limiting bandwidth usage

   From version 1.2.1, it is possible to limit the usage of I/O bandwidth
   through the bandwidth_limit option (global/per server), by specifying
   the maximum number of kilobytes per second. By default it is set to 0,
   meaning no limit.

   In case you have several tablespaces and you prefer to limit the I/O
   workload of your backup procedures on one or more tablespaces, you can
   use the tablespace_bandwidth_limit option (global/per server):

     tablespace_bandwidth_limit = tbname:bwlimit[, tbname:bwlimit, ...]

   The option accepts a comma separated list of pairs made up of the
   tablespace name and the bandwidth limit (in kilobytes per second).

   When backing up a server, Barman will try and locate any existing
   tablespace in the above option. If found, the specified bandwidth limit
   will be enforced. If not, the default bandwidth limit for that server
   will be applied.
     __________________________________________________________________

Network Compression

   From version 1.3.0 it is possible to reduce the size of transferred
   data using compression. It can be enabled using the network_compression
   option (global/per server):

     network_compression = true|false

   Setting this option to true will enable data compression during network
   transfers (for both backup and recovery). By default it is set to
   false.
     __________________________________________________________________

Backup ID shortcuts

   As of version 1.1.2, you can use any of the following shortcuts to
   identify a particular backup for a given server:
     * latest: the latest available backup for that server, in
       chronological order. You can also use the last synonym.
     * oldest: the oldest available backup for that server, in
       chronological order. You can also use the first synonym.

   These aliases can be used with any of the following commands:
   show-backup, delete, list-files and recover.
     __________________________________________________________________

Minimum redundancy safety

   From version 1.2.0, you can define the minimum number of periodical
   backups for a PostgreSQL server.

   You can use the global/per server configuration option called
   minimum_redundancy for this purpose, by default set to 0.

   By setting this value to any number greater than 0, Barman makes sure
   that at any time you will have at least that number of backups in a
   server catalogue.

   This will protect you from accidental barman delete operations.

   Important
            Make sure that your policy retention settings do not collide with
            minimum redundancy requirements. Regularly check Barman’s log for
            messages on this topic.
     __________________________________________________________________

Retention policies

   From version 1.2.0, Barman supports retention policies for backups.

   A backup retention policy is an user-defined policy that determines how
   long backups and related archive logs (Write Ahead Log segments) need
   to be retained for recovery procedures.

   Based on the user’s request, Barman retains the periodical backups
   required to satisfy the current retention policy, and any archived WAL
   files required for the complete recovery of those backups.

   Barman users can define a retention policy in terms of backup
   redundancy (how many periodical backups) or a recovery window (how
   long).

   Retention policy based on redundancy
          In a retention policy, the setting that determines how many
          periodical backups to keep. A redundancy-based retention policy
          is contrasted with retention policy that uses a recovery window.

   Retention policy based on recovery window
          A recovery window is one type of Barman backup retention policy,
          in which the DBA specifies a period of time and Barman ensures
          retention of backups and/or archived WAL files required for
          point-in-time recovery to any time during the recovery window.
          The interval always ends with the current time and extends back
          in time for the number of days specified by the user. For
          example, if the retention policy is set for a recovery window of
          seven days, and the current time is 9:30 AM on Friday, Barman
          retains the backups required to allow point-in-time recovery
          back to 9:30 AM on the previous Friday.

  Scope

   Retention policies can be defined for:
     * PostgreSQL periodical base backups: through the retention_policy
       configuration option;
     * Archive logs, for Point-In-Time-Recovery: through the
       wal_retention_policy configuration option.

   Important
            In a temporal dimension, archive logs must be included in the time
            window of periodical backups.

   There are two typical use cases here: full or partial point-in-time
   recovery.

   Full point in time recovery scenario
          Base backups and archive logs share the same retention policy,
          allowing DBAs to recover at any point in time from the first
          available backup.

   Partial point in time recovery scenario
          Base backup retention policy is wider than that of archive logs,
          allowing users for example to keep full weekly backups of the
          last 6 months, but archive logs for the last 4 weeks (granting
          to recover at any point in time starting from the last 4
          periodical weekly backups).

   Important
            Currently, Barman implements only the full point in time recovery
            scenario, by constraining the wal_retention_policy option to main.

  How they work

   Retention policies in Barman can be:
     * automated: enforced by barman cron;
     * manual: Barman simply reports obsolete backups and allows DBAs to
       delete them.

   Important
            Currently Barman does not implement manual enforcement. This feature
            will be available in future versions.

  Configuration and syntax

   Retention policies can be defined through the following configuration
   options:
     * retention_policy: for base backup retention;
     * wal_retention_policy: for archive logs retention;
     * retention_policy_mode: can only be set to auto (retention policies
       are automatically enforced by the barman cron command).

   These configuration options can be defined both at a global level and a
   server level, allowing users maximum flexibility on a multi-server
   environment.

    Syntax for retention_policy

   The general syntax for a base backup retention policy through
   retention_policy is the following:

   retention_policy = {REDUNDANCY value | RECOVERY WINDOW OF value {DAYS | WEEKS
 | MONTHS}}

   Where:
     * syntax is case insensitive;
     * value is an integer and is > 0;
     * in case of redundancy retention policy:
          + value must be greater than or equal to the server minimum
            redundancy level (if not is is assigned to that value and a
            warning is generated);
          + the first valid backup is the value-th backup in a reverse
            ordered time series;
     * in case of recovery window policy:
          + the point of recoverability is: current time - window;
          + the first valid backup is the first available backup before
            the point of recoverability; its value in a reverse ordered
            time series must be greater than or equal to the server
            minimum redundancy level (if not is is assigned to that value
            and a warning is generated).

   By default, retention_policy is empty (no retention enforced).

    Syntax for wal_retention_policy

   Currently, the only allowed value for wal_retention_policy is the
   special value main, that maps the retention policy of archive logs to
   that of base backups.

Concurrent Backup and backup from a standby

   Normally, during backup operations, Barman uses PostgreSQL native
   functions pg_start_backup and pg_stop_backup for exclusive backup.
   These operations are not allowed on a read-only standby server.

   As of version 1.3.1, Barman is also capable of performing backups of
   PostgreSQL 9.2/9.3 database servers in a concurrent way, primarily
   through the backup_options configuration parameter.
   [Concurrent backup is a technology that has been available in
   PostgreSQL since version 9.1, through the streaming replication
   protocol (using, for example, a tool like pg_basebackup).]
   This introduces a new architecture scenario with Barman: backup from a
   standby server, using rsync.

Important
         Concurrent backup requires users of PostgreSQL 9.2 and 9.3 to install
         the pgespresso open source extension on the PostgreSQL server. Detailed
         information as well as the source code of pgespresso can be found at
         [6]https://github.com/2ndquadrant-it/pgespresso.

   By default, backup_options is transparently set to exclusive_backup
   (the only supported method by any Barman version prior to 1.3.1).

   When backup_options is set to concurrent_backup, Barman activates the
   concurrent backup mode for a server and follows these two simple rules:
     * ssh_command must point to the destination Postgres server;
     * conninfo must point to a database on the destination Postgres 9.2
       or 9.3 server where pgespresso is correctly installed through
       CREATE EXTENSION.

   The destination Postgres server can be either the master or a streaming
   replicated standby server.

   Note
       When backing up from a standby server, continuous archiving of WAL
       files must be configured on the master to ship files to the Barman
       server (as outlined in the "Continuous WAL archiving" section above).
       [ In case of concurrent backup, currently Barman does not have a way to
       determine that the closing WAL file of a full backup has actually been
       shipped - opposite to the case of an exclusive backup where it is
       Postgres itself that makes sure that the WAL file is correctly
       archived. Be aware that the full backup cannot be considered consistent
       until that WAL file has been received and archived by Barman. We
       encourage Barman users to wait to delete the previous backup - at least
       until that moment. ]
     __________________________________________________________________

Available commands

   Barman commands are applied to three different levels:
     * general commands, which apply to the backup catalogue
     * server commands, which apply to a specific server (list available
       backups, execute a backup, etc.)
     * backup commands, which apply to a specific backup in the catalogue
       (display information, issue a recovery, delete the backup, etc.)

   In the following sections the available commands will be described in
   detail.

  General commands

    List available servers

   You can display the list of active servers that have been configured
   for your backup system with:

     barman list-server

    Maintenance mode

   You can perform maintenance operations, like compressing WAL files and
   moving them from the incoming directory to the archived one, with:

     barman cron

   This command enforces retention policies on those servers that have:
     * retention_policy not empty and valid;
     * retention_policy_mode set to auto.

   Note
       This command should be executed in a cron script.

  Server commands

    Show the configuration for a given server

   You can show the configuration parameters for a given server with:

     barman show-server <server_name>

    Take a base backup

   You can perform a full backup (base backup) for a given server with:

     barman backup [--immediate-checkpoint] <server_name>

   Tip
      You can use barman backup all to sequentially backup all your
      configured servers.

    Show available backups for a server

   You can list the catalogue of available backups for a given server
   with:

     barman list-backup <server_name>

    Check a server is properly working

   You can check if the connection to a given server is properly working
   with:

     barman check <server_name>

   Tip
      You can use barman check all to check all your configured servers.

   From version 1.3.3, you can automatically be notified if the latest
   backup of a given server is older than, for example, 7 days.
   [This feature is commonly known among the development team members as
   smelly backup check]
   Barman introduces the option named last_backup_maximum_age having the
   following syntax:

     last_backup_maximum_age = {value {DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS}}

   where value is a positive integer representing the number of days,
   weeks or months of the time frame.

    Diagnose a Barman installation

   You can gather important information about all the configured server
   using:

     barman diagnose

   The diagnose command also provides other useful information, such as
   global configuration, SSH version, Python version, rsync version, as
   well as current configuration and status of all servers.

   Tip
      You can use barman diagnose when you want to ask questions or report
      errors to Barman developers, providing them with all the information
      about your issue.

    Rebuild the WAL archive

   At any time, you can regenerate the content of the WAL archive for a
   specific server (or every server, using the all shortcut). The WAL
   archive is contained in the xlog.db file, and every Barman server has
   its own copy. From version 1.2.4 you can now rebuild the xlog.db file
   with the rebuild-xlogdb command. This will scan all the archived WAL
   files and regenerate the metadata for the archive.

  Important
           Users of Barman < 1.2.3 might have suffered from a bug due to bad
           locking in highly concurrent environments. You can now regenerate the
           WAL archive using the rebuild-xlogdb command.

     barman rebuild-xlogdb <server_name>

  Backup commands

   Note
       Remember: a backup ID can be retrieved with server list <server_name>

    Show backup information

   You can show all the available information for a particular backup of a
   given server with:

     barman show-backup <server_name> <backup_id>

   From version 1.1.2, in order to show the latest backup, you can issue:

     barman show-backup <server_name> latest

    Delete a backup

   You can delete a given backup with:

     barman delete <server_name> <backup_id>

   From version 1.1.2, in order to delete the oldest backup, you can
   issue:

     barman delete <server_name> oldest

   Warning
          Until retention policies are natively supported, you must use the
          oldest shortcut with extreme care and caution. Iteratively executing
          this command can easily wipe out your backup archive.

    List backup files

   You can list the files (base backup and required WAL files) for a given
   backup with:

     barman list-files [--target TARGET_TYPE] <server_name> <backup_id>

   With the --target TARGET_TYPE option, it is possible to choose the
   content of the list for a given backup.

   Possible values for TARGET_TYPE are:
     * data: lists just the data files;
     * standalone: lists the base backup files, including required WAL
       files;
     * wal: lists all WAL files from the beginning of the base backup to
       the start of the following one (or until the end of the log);
     * full: same as data + wal.

   The default value for TARGET_TYPE is standalone.

Important
         The list-files command facilitates interaction with external tools, and
         therefore can be extremely useful to integrate Barman into your
         archiving procedures.
     __________________________________________________________________

Hook scripts

   Barman allows a database administrator to run hook scripts on these two
   events:
     * before and after a backup
     * before and after a WAL file is archived

 Important
          No check is performed on the exit code of a script. The result will be
          simply written in the log file.

  Backup scripts

   Version 1.1.0 introduced backup scripts.

   These scripts can be configured with the following global configuration
   options (which can be overridden on a per server basis):
     * pre_backup_script: hook script launched before a base backup
     * post_backup_script: hook script launched after a base backup

   The script definition is passed to a shell and can return any exit
   code.

   The shell environment will contain the following variables:
     * BARMAN_BACKUP_DIR: backup destination directory
     * BARMAN_BACKUP_ID: ID of the backup
     * BARMAN_CONFIGURATION: configuration file used by barman
     * BARMAN_ERROR: error message, if any (only for the post phase)
     * BARMAN_PHASE: phase of the script, either pre or post
     * BARMAN_PREVIOUS_ID: ID of the previous backup (if present)
     * BARMAN_SERVER: name of the server
     * BARMAN_STATUS: status of the backup
     * BARMAN_VERSION: version of Barman (from 1.2.1)

  WAL archive scripts

   Version 1.3.0 introduced WAL archive hook scripts.

   Similarly to backup scripts, archive scripts can be configured with
   global configuration options (which can be overridden on a per server
   basis):
     * pre_archive_script: hook script launched before a WAL file is
       archived by maintenance (usually barman cron)
     * post_archive_script: hook script launched after a WAL file is
       archived by maintenance

   The script is executed through a shell and can return any exit code.

   Archive scripts share with backup scripts some environmental variables:
     * BARMAN_CONFIGURATION: configuration file used by barman
     * BARMAN_ERROR: error message, if any (only for the post phase)
     * BARMAN_PHASE: phase of the script, either pre or post
     * BARMAN_SERVER: name of the server

   Following variables are specific to archive scripts:
     * BARMAN_SEGMENT: name of the WAL file
     * BARMAN_FILE: full path of the WAL file
     * BARMAN_SIZE: size of the WAL file
     * BARMAN_TIMESTAMP: WAL file timestamp
     * BARMAN_COMPRESSION: type of compression used for the WAL file
