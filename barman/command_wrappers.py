        If the `args` argument is specified the arguments will be always added
        to the ones eventually passed with the actual invocation.

        If the `env_append` argument is present its content will be appended to
        the environment of every invocation.

        The subprocess output and error stream will be processed through
        the output and error handler, respectively defined through the
        `out_handler` and `err_handler` arguments. If not provided every line
        will be sent to the log respectively at INFO and WARNING level.

        The `out_handler` and the `err_handler` functions will be invoked with
        one single argument, which is a string containing the line that is
        being processed.

        If the `close_fds` argument is True, all file descriptors
        except 0, 1 and 2 will be closed before the child process is executed.

        If the `check` argument is True, the exit code will be checked
        against the `allowed_retval` list, raising a CommandFailedException if
        not in the list.

        If `retry_times` is greater than 0, when the execution of a command
        terminates with an error, it will be retried for
        a maximum of `retry_times` times, waiting for `retry_sleep` seconds
        between every attempt.

        Every time a command is retried the `retry_handler` is executed
        before running the command again. The retry_handler must be a callable
        that accepts the following fields:

         * the Command object
         * the arguments list
         * the keyword arguments dictionary
         * the number of the failed attempt
         * the exception containing the error

        An example of such a function is:

            > def retry_handler(command, args, kwargs, attempt, exc):
            >     print("Failed command!")

        Some of the keyword arguments can be specified both in the class
        constructor and during the method call. If specified in both places,
        the method arguments will take the precedence over
        the constructor arguments.
