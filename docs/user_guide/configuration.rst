Configuration Reference
=======================

Barman follows a convention over configuration approach, which simplifies configuration
by allowing some options to be defined globally and overridden at the server level. This
means you can set a default behavior for your servers and then customize specific servers
as needed. This design reduces the need for excessive configuration while maintaining
flexibility.

.. _configuration-usage:

Usage
-----

Proper configuration is critical for its effective operation. Barman uses different types
of configuration files to manage global settings, server-specific settings, and
model-specific settings that is made up of three scopes:
 
1. **Global Configuration**: It comprises one file with a set of configurations for the
barman system, such as the main directory, system user, log file, and other general
options. Default location is ``/etc/barman.conf`` and it can be overridden on a per-user
level by ``~/.barman.conf`` or by specifying a ``.conf`` file using the ``-c`` /
``--config`` with the :ref:`barman command <commands-barman>` directly in the CLI.

2. **Server Configuration**: It comprises one or more files with a set of
configurations for a Postgres server that you want to keep track and interact for
backup, recovery and/or replication. Default location is ``/etc/barman.d`` and must use
the ``.conf`` suffix. You may have one or multiple files for servers. You can override the
default location by setting the ``configuration_files_directory`` option in the global
configuration file and placing the files in that particular location.

3. **Model Configuration**: It comprises one or more files with a set of
configurations overrides that can be applied to Barman servers within the same cluster as
the model. These overrides can be implemented using the barman ``config-switch`` command.
Default location is ``/etc/barman.d`` and must use the ``.conf`` suffix. The same
``configuration_files_directory`` override option from the server configuration applies for
models. You may have one or multiple files for models.

.. note::
  Historically, you could have a single configuration file containing global, server, and
  model options, but, for maintenance reasons, this approach is deprecated.

Configuration files follow the ``INI`` format and consist of sections denoted by headers
in square brackets. Each section can include various options.

Models and servers must have unique identifiers, and reserved words cannot be used as
names.

**Reserved Words**

The following reserved words cannot be used as server or model names:

* ``barman``: Identifies the global section.
* ``all``: A special shortcut for executing commands on all managed servers.

**Parameter Types**

Configuration options can be of the following types:

* **String**: Textual data (e.g., file paths, names).
* **Enum**: Enumerated values, often limited to predefined choices.
* **Integer**: Numeric values.
* **Boolean**: Can be ``on``, ``true``, ``1`` (true) or ``off``, ``false``, ``0`` 
  (false).

  .. note::
    Some enums allow ``off``, but not ``false``.

.. _configuration-options:

Options
-------

Options in the configuration files can have specific or shared scopes. The following
configuration options are used not only for configuring how Barman will execute backups
and recoveries, but also for configuring various aspects of how Barman interacts with the
configured Postgres servers to be able to apply your Backup and Recovery, and
High-Availability strategies.

.. _configuration-options-general:

General
"""""""

These are general configurations options.

**active**

When this option is set to ``true`` (default), the server operates fully. If set to
``false``, the server is restricted to diagnostic use only, meaning that operational
commands such as backup execution or WAL archiving are temporarily disabled. When
incorporating a new server into Barman, we recommend initially setting
``active = false``. Verify that barman check shows no issues before activating the
server. This approach helps prevent excessive error logging in Barman during the
initial setup.

Scope: Server / Model.

**archiver**

This option enables log file shipping through Postgres' ``archive_command`` for a
server. When set to ``true``, Barman expects continuous archiving to be configured and
will manage WAL files that Postgres stores in the incoming directory
(``incoming_wals_directory``), including their checks, handling, and compression. When
set to ``false`` (default), continuous archiving is disabled. 
  
.. note:: 
  If neither ``archiver`` nor ``streaming_archiver`` is configured, Barman will
  automatically set this option to ``true`` to maintain compatibility with the
  previous default behavior where archiving was enabled by default.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**archiver_batch_size**

This option enables batch processing of WAL files for the archiver process by setting
it to a value greater than ``0``. If not set, the archiver will use unlimited
(default) processing mode for the WAL queue. With batch processing enabled, the
archiver process will handle a maximum of ``archiver_batch_size`` WAL segments per
run. This value must be an integer.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**bandwidth_limit**

Specifies the maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per second for backup and recovery
operations. A value of ``0`` indicates no limit (default).

.. note::
  Applies only when ``backup_method = postgres | rsync``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**barman_home**

Designates the main data directory for Barman. Defaults to ``/var/lib/barman``.

Scope: Global.

**barman_lock_directory**

Specifies the directory for lock files. The default is ``barman_home``.

.. note::
  The ``barman_lock_directory`` should be on a non-network local filesystem.

Scope: Global.

**basebackup_retry_sleep**

Sets the number of seconds to wait after a failed base backup copy before retrying.
Default is ``30`` seconds. Must be a non-negative integer.

.. note::
  This applies to both backup and recovery operations.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**basebackup_retry_times**

Defines the number of retry attempts for a base backup copy after an error occurs.
Default is ``0`` (no retries). Must be a non-negative integer.

.. note::
  This applies to both backup and recovery operations.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**check_timeout**

Sets the maximum execution time in seconds for a Barman check command per server. Set
to ``0`` to disable the timeout. Default is ``30`` seconds. Must be a non-negative
integer.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**cluster**

Tag the server or model to an associated cluster name. Barman uses this association to
override configuration for all servers/models in this cluster. If omitted for servers,
it defaults to the server's name.

.. note::
  Must be specified for configuration models to group applicable servers.

Scope: Server / Model.

**config_changes_queue**

Designates the filesystem location for Barman's queue that handles configuration changes
requested via the barman ``config-update`` command. This queue manages the
serialization and retry of configuration change requests. By default, Barman writes to
a file named ``cfg_changes.queue`` under ``barman_home``.

Scope: Global.

**configuration_files_directory**

Designates the directory where server/model configuration files will be read by Barman.
Defaults to ``/etc/barman.d/``.

Scope: Global.

**conninfo**

Specifies the connection string used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server.
This is a libpq connection string. Commonly used keys include: ``host``, ``hostaddr``,
``port``, ``dbname``, ``user`` and ``password``. See the 
`PostgreSQL documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING>`_
for details.

Scope: Server / Model.

**create_slot**

Determines whether Barman should automatically create a replication slot if it's not
already present for streaming WAL files. When set to ``auto`` and ``slot_name`` is
defined, Barman will attempt to create the slot automatically. When set to ``manual``
(default), the replication slot must be created manually.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**description**

Provides a human-readable description of a server.

Scope: Server / Model.

**errors_directory**

The directory where WAL files that were errored while being archived by Barman are 
stored. This includes duplicate WAL files (e.g., an archived WAL file that has already
been streamed but have different hash) and unexpected files found in the WAL archive
directory.

The purpose of placing the files in this directory is so someone can later review why they 
failed to be archived and take appropriate actions (dispose of, store somewhere else, 
replace the duplicate file archived before, etc.)

Scope: Server.

**forward_config_path**

Determines whether a passive node should forward its configuration file path to its
primary node during ``cron`` or ``sync-info`` commands. Set to ``true`` if Barman is
invoked with the ``-c`` / ``--config`` option and the configuration paths are identical
on both passive and primary Barman servers. Defaults to ``false``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**immediate_checkpoint**

Controls how Postgres handles checkpoints at the start of a backup. Set to ``false``
(default) to allow the checkpoint to complete according to
``checkpoint_completion_target``. Set to ``true`` for an immediate checkpoint, where
Postgres completes the checkpoint as quickly as possible.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**keepalive_interval**

Sets the interval in seconds for sending a heartbeat query to keep the libpq
connection active during an rsync backup. Default is ``60`` seconds. Setting this to
``0`` disables the heartbeat.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**lock_directory_cleanup**

Enables automatic cleanup of unused lock files in the ``barman_lock_directory``.

Scope: Global.

**log_file**

Specifies the location of Barman's log file. Defaults to ``/var/log/barman/barman.log``.

Scope: Global.

**log_level**

Sets the level of logging. Options include: ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``,
``ERROR`` and ``CRITICAL``.

Scope: Global.

**minimum_redundancy**

Specifies the minimum number of backups to retain. Default is ``0``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**model**

When set to ``true``, turns a server section from a configuration file into a model for
a cluster. There is no ``false`` option in this case. If you want to simulate a 
``false`` option, comment out (``#model=true``) or remove the option in the
configuration. Defaults to the server name.

Scope: Model.

**network_compression**

Enables or disables data compression for network transfers. Set to ``false`` (default)
to disable compression, or ``true`` to enable it and reduce network usage.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

.. _configuration-parallel-jobs:

**parallel_jobs**

Controls the number of parallel workers used to copy files during backup or recovery.
It must be a positive integer. Default is ``1``.

.. note::
  Applies only when ``backup_method = rsync``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**parallel_jobs_start_batch_period**

Specifies the time interval in seconds over which a single batch of parallel jobs will
start. Default is ``1`` second. This means that if ``parallel_jobs_start_batch_size``
is ``10`` and ``parallel_jobs_start_batch_period`` is ``1``, this will yield an
effective rate limit of ``10`` jobs per second, because there is a maximum of ``10``
jobs that can be started within ``1`` second.

.. note::
  Applies only when ``backup_method = rsync``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**parallel_jobs_start_batch_size**

Defines the maximum number of parallel jobs to start in a single batch. Default is
``10`` jobs. This means that if ``parallel_jobs_start_batch_size``
is ``10`` and ``parallel_jobs_start_batch_period`` is ``2``, this will yield a maximum
of ``10`` jobs that can be started within ``2`` seconds.

.. note::
  Applies only when ``backup_method = rsync``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**path_prefix**

Lists one or more absolute paths, separated by colons, where Barman looks for executable
files. These paths are checked before the ``PATH`` environment variable. This option can
be set for each server and needs to point to the ``bin`` directory for the appropriate
``PG_MAJOR_VERSION``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**primary_checkpoint_timeout**

Time to wait for new WAL files before forcing a checkpoint on the primary server.
Defaults to ``0``.

Scope: Server / Model.

**streaming_archiver**

Enables Postgres' streaming protocol for WAL files. Defaults to ``false``.

.. note:: 
  If neither ``archiver`` nor ``streaming_archiver`` is configured, Barman will
  automatically set ``archiver`` option to ``true`` to maintain compatibility with the
  previous default behavior where archiving was enabled by default.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**streaming_archiver_batch_size**

Batch size for processing WAL files in streaming archiver. Defaults to ``0``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**streaming_archiver_name**

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**backup_compression**

Specifies the compression method for the backup process. It can be set to ``gzip``,
``lz4``, ``zstd``, or ``none``. Ensure that the CLI tool for the chosen compression
method is available on both the Barman and Postgres servers. 
  
.. note::
  Note that ``lz4`` and ``zstd`` require Postgres version 15 or later. Unsetting this
  option or using ``none`` results in an uncompressed archive (default). Only
  supported when ``backup_method = postgres``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**backup_compression_format**

  ``snapshot_disks`` and saves only the backup label and metadata to its own
  storage.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**backup_options**

Controls how Barman interacts with Postgres during backups. This is a comma-separated
list that can include:

* ``concurrent_backup`` (default): Uses concurrent backup, recommended for
  Postgres versions 9.6 and later, and supports backups from standby servers.
* ``exclusive_backup``: Uses the deprecated exclusive backup method. Only for Postgres 
  versions older than 15. This option will be removed in the future.
* ``external_configuration``: Suppresses warnings about external configuration files
  during backup execution.

files. If this is set, Barman will avoid applying custom compression to WALs that have
already been compressed with the specified algorithm. If not configured, Barman will
apply custom compression to all WAL files, even those pre-compressed.

.. tip::
  For example, in the ``xz`` compression algorithm, the magic number is used to detect
  the format of ``.xz`` files.

  For xz files, the magic number is the following sequence of bytes:
    Magic Number: ``FD 37 7A 58 5A 00``

  In hexadecimal representation, this can be expressed as:
    Hex String: ``fd377a585a00``

  Reference: `xz-file-format <https://tukaani.org/xz/xz-file-format-1.0.4.txt>`_

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**custom_decompression_filter**

Specifies a custom decompression algorithm for compressed WAL files. It must be a
``string`` that will be used internally to create a bash command and it will
prefix to the following string ``> "$2" < "$1";``. It must correspond with the
compression algorithm used.

.. tip::
  ``custom_compression_filter = "xz -c -d"``

  This is the same as running ``xz -c -d > "$2" < "$1";``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**incoming_wals_directory**

Specifies the directory where incoming WAL files are archived. Requires ``archiver`` to
be enabled. Defaults to ``<backup_directory>/incoming``.

Scope: Server.

**last_wal_maximum_age**

Defines the time frame within which the latest archived WAL file must fall. If the
latest WAL file is older than this period, the barman check command will report an
error. If left empty (default), the age of the WAL files is not checked. Format is the
same as ``last_backup_maximum_age``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**max_incoming_wals_queue**

Defines the maximum number of WAL files allowed in the incoming queue (including both
streaming and archiving pools) before the barman check command returns an error.
Default is ``None`` (disabled).

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**streaming_wals_directory**

Directory for streaming WAL files. Defaults to ``<backup_directory>/streaming``.

.. note::
  This option is applicable when ``streaming_archiver`` is activated.
  
Scope: Server.

**wal_conninfo**

The ``wal_conninfo`` connection string is used by Barman for monitoring the status of
the replication slot receiving WALs. If specified, it takes precedence over
``wal_streaming_conninfo`` for these checks. If ``wal_conninfo`` is not set but
``wal_streaming_conninfo`` is, ``wal_conninfo`` will fall back to
``wal_streaming_conninfo``. If neither ``wal_conninfo`` nor ``wal_streaming_conninfo``
is set, ``wal_conninfo`` will fall back to ``conninfo``. Both connection strings must
access a Postgres instance within the same cluster as defined by ``streaming_conninfo``
and ``conninfo``. If both ``wal_conninfo`` and ``wal_streaming_conninfo`` are set, only
``wal_conninfo`` needs the appropriate permissions to read settings and check the
replication slot status. However, if only ``wal_streaming_conninfo`` is set, it must
have the necessary permissions to perform these tasks. The required permissions include
roles such as ``pg_monitor``, both ``pg_read_all_settings`` and ``pg_read_all_stats``,
or superuser privileges.

Scope: Server / Model.

**wal_streaming_conninfo**

This connection string is used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server for receiving
WAL segments via streaming replication and checking the replication slot status, if
``wal_conninfo`` is not set. If not specified, Barman defaults to using
``streaming_conninfo`` for these tasks. ``wal_streaming_conninfo`` must connect to a
Postgres instance within the same cluster as defined by ``streaming_conninfo``, and it
must support streaming replication. If both ``wal_streaming_conninfo`` and
``wal_conninfo`` are set, only ``wal_conninfo`` needs the required permissions to read
settings and check the replication slot status. If only ``wal_streaming_conninfo`` is
specified, it must have these permissions. The necessary permissions include roles such
as ``pg_monitor``, both ``pg_read_all_settings`` and ``pg_read_all_stats``, or superuser
privileges.

Scope: Server / Model.

**wals_directory**

Directory containing WAL files. Defaults to ``<backup_directory>/wals``.

Scope: Server.

.. _configuration-options-restore:

Restore
"""""""

These configuration options are related to how Barman manages restoration backups.

**local_staging_path**

Specifies the local path for combining block-level incremental backups during recovery.
This location must have sufficient space to temporarily store the new synthetic backup.
Required for recovery from a block-level incremental backup.

.. note::
  Applies only when ``backup_method = postgres``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**recovery_options**

Options for recovery operations. Currently, only ``get-wal`` is supported. This option
enables the creation of a basic ``restore_command`` in the recovery configuration,
which uses the barman ``get-wal`` command to retrieve WAL files directly from Barman's
WAL archive. This setting accepts a comma-separated list of values and defaults to
empty.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**recovery_staging_path**

Specifies the path on the recovery host for staging files from compressed backups. This
location must have sufficient space to temporarily store the compressed backup.

.. note::
  Applies only for commpressed backups.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

.. _configuration-options-retention-policies:

Retention Policies
""""""""""""""""""

These configuration options are related to how Barman manages retention policies of the
backups.

**last_backup_maximum_age**

Defines the time frame within which the latest backup must fall. If the latest backup
is older than this period, the barman check command will report an error. If left
empty (default), the latest backup is always considered valid. The accepted format is
``"n {DAYS|WEEKS|MONTHS}"``, where ``n`` is an integer greater than zero.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**last_backup_minimum_size**

Specifies the minimum acceptable size for the latest successful backup. If the latest
backup is smaller than this size, the barman check command will report an error. If
left empty (default), the latest backup is always considered valid. The accepted
format is ``"n {k|Ki|M|Mi|G|Gi|T|Ti}"`` and case-sensitive, where ``n`` is an integer
greater than zero, with an optional SI or IEC suffix. k stands for kilo with k = 1000,
while Ki stands for kilobytes Ki = 1024. The rest of the options have the same
reasoning for greater units of measure.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**retention_policy**

Defines how long backups and WAL files should be retained. If this option is left blank,
no retention policies will be applied. Options include redundancy and recovery window
policies. 
  
.. code-block:: text

  retention_policy = {REDUNDANCY value | RECOVERY WINDOW OF value {DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS}}

* ``retention_policy = REDUNDANCY 2`` will keep only 2 backups in the backup catalog
  automatically deleting the older one as new backups are created. The number must be
  a positive integer.
* ``retention_policy = RECOVERY WINDOW OF 2 DAYS`` will only keep backups needed to
  recover to any point in time in the last two days, automatically deleting backups
  that are older. The period number must be a positive integer, and   the following
  options can be applied to it: ``DAYS``, ``WEEKS``, ``MONTHS``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**retention_policy_mode**

Mode for enforcing retention policies. Currently only supports ``auto``.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

**wal_retention_policy**

Policy for retaining WAL files. Currently only ``main`` is available.

Scope: Global / Server / Model.

.. _configuration-configuration-models:

Configuration Models
--------------------

Configuration models provide a systematic approach to manage and apply configuration
overrides for Postgres servers by organizing them under a specific ``cluster`` name.

Purpose
"""""""

The primary goal of a configuration model is to simplify the management of configuration
settings for Postgres servers grouped by the same ``cluster``. By using a model, you can
apply a set of common configuration overrides, enhancing operational efficiency. They are
especially beneficial in clustered environments, allowing you to create various
configuration models that can be utilized during failover events.

Application
"""""""""""

The configurations defined in a model file can be applied to Postgres servers that share
the same ``cluster`` name specified in the model. Consequently, any server utilizing that
model can inherit these settings, promoting a consistent and adaptable configuration
across all servers. 

Usage
"""""

Model options can only be defined within a model section, which is identified in the same
way as a server section. It is important to ensure that there are no conflicts between
the identifiers of server sections and model sections.

To apply a configuration model, execute the
``barman config-switch SERVER_NAME MODEL_NAME``. This command facilitates the application
of the model's overrides to the relevant Barman server associated with the specified
cluster name.

If you wish to remove the overrides, the deletion of the model configuration file alone
will not have any effect, so you can do so by using the ``--reset`` argument with the
command, as follows: ``barman config-switch SERVER_NAME --reset``.

.. note::
  The ``config-switch`` command will only succeed if model name exists and is associated
  with the same ``cluster`` as the server. Additionally, there can be only one active
  model at a time; if you execute the command multiple times with different models, only
  the overrides defined in the last model will be applied.

  Not all options can be configured through models. Please review the scope of the
  available configurations to determine which settings apply to models.

Benefits
""""""""

* Consistency: Ensures uniform configuration across multiple Barman servers within a
  cluster.
* Efficiency: Simplifies configuration management by allowing centralized updates and
  overrides.
* Flexibility: Allows the use of multiple model files, providing the ability to define
  various sets of overrides as necessary.

  Examples
  --------

  Barman global configurations are common between all configured servers. So if you want to
  have specific configurations, you should move it to the server scope instead of the barman
  global scope.

  explanation of the fields.
