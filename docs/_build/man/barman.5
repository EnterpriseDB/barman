.SH NAME
barman \- Barman Configurations
.sp
Barman follows a convention over configuration approach, which simplifies configuration
by allowing some options to be defined globally and overridden at the server level. This
means you can set a default behavior for your servers and then customize specific servers
as needed. This design reduces the need for excessive configuration while maintaining
flexibility.
.SH USAGE
.sp
Proper configuration is critical for its effective operation. Barman uses different types
of configuration files to manage global settings, server\-specific settings, and
model\-specific settings that is made up of three scopes:
.sp
1. \fBGlobal Configuration\fP: It comprises one file with a set of configurations for the
barman system, such as the main directory, system user, log file, and other general
options. Default location is \fB/etc/barman.conf\fP and it can be overridden on a per\-user
level by \fB~/.barman.conf\fP or by specifying a \fB\&.conf\fP file using the \fB\-c\fP /
\fB\-\-config\fP with the \fI\%barman command\fP directly in the CLI.
.sp
2. \fBServer Configuration\fP: It comprises one or more files with a set of
configurations for a Postgres server that you want to keep track and interact for
backup, recovery and/or replication. Default location is \fB/etc/barman.d\fP and must use
the \fB\&.conf\fP suffix. You may have one or multiple files for servers. You can override the
default location by setting the \fBconfiguration_files_directory\fP option in the global
configuration file and placing the files in that particular location.
.sp
3. \fBModel Configuration\fP: It comprises one or more files with a set of
configurations overrides that can be applied to Barman servers within the same cluster as
the model. These overrides can be implemented using the barman \fBconfig\-switch\fP command.
Default location is \fB/etc/barman.d\fP and must use the \fB\&.conf\fP suffix. The same
\fBconfiguration_files_directory\fP override option from the server configuration applies for
models. You may have one or multiple files for models.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Historically, you could have a single configuration file containing global, server, and
model options, but, for maintenance reasons, this approach is deprecated.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Configuration files follow the \fBINI\fP format and consist of sections denoted by headers
in square brackets. Each section can include various options.
.sp
Models and servers must have unique identifiers, and reserved words cannot be used as
names.
.sp
\fBReserved Words\fP
.sp
The following reserved words cannot be used as server or model names:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbarman\fP: Identifies the global section.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBall\fP: A special shortcut for executing commands on all managed servers.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBParameter Types\fP
.sp
Configuration options can be of the following types:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBString\fP: Textual data (e.g., file paths, names).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEnum\fP: Enumerated values, often limited to predefined choices.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBInteger\fP: Numeric values.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBoolean\fP: Can be \fBon\fP, \fBtrue\fP, \fB1\fP (true) or \fBoff\fP, \fBfalse\fP, \fB0\fP
(false).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some enums allow \fBoff\fP, but not \fBfalse\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Options in the configuration files can have specific or shared scopes. The following
configuration options are used not only for configuring how Barman will execute backups
and recoveries, but also for configuring various aspects of how Barman interacts with the
configured Postgres servers to be able to apply your Backup and Recovery, and
High\-Availability strategies.
.SS General
.sp
These are general configurations options.
.sp
\fBactive\fP
.sp
When this option is set to \fBtrue\fP (default), the server operates fully. If set to
\fBfalse\fP, the server is restricted to diagnostic use only, meaning that operational
commands such as backup execution or WAL archiving are temporarily disabled. When
incorporating a new server into Barman, we recommend initially setting
\fBactive = false\fP\&. Verify that barman check shows no issues before activating the
server. This approach helps prevent excessive error logging in Barman during the
initial setup.
.sp
Scope: Server / Model.
.sp
\fBarchiver\fP
.sp
This option enables log file shipping through Postgres\(aq \fBarchive_command\fP for a
server. When set to \fBtrue\fP, Barman expects continuous archiving to be configured and
will manage WAL files that Postgres stores in the incoming directory
(\fBincoming_wals_directory\fP), including their checks, handling, and compression. When
set to \fBfalse\fP (default), continuous archiving is disabled.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If neither \fBarchiver\fP nor \fBstreaming_archiver\fP is configured, Barman will
automatically set this option to \fBtrue\fP to maintain compatibility with the
previous default behavior where archiving was enabled by default.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBarchiver_batch_size\fP
.sp
This option enables batch processing of WAL files for the archiver process by setting
it to a value greater than \fB0\fP\&. If not set, the archiver will use unlimited
(default) processing mode for the WAL queue. With batch processing enabled, the
archiver process will handle a maximum of \fBarchiver_batch_size\fP WAL segments per
run. This value must be an integer.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBbandwidth_limit\fP
.sp
Specifies the maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per second for backup and recovery
operations. A value of \fB0\fP indicates no limit (default).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
Specifies the directory for lock files. The default is \fBbarman_home\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fBbasebackup_retry_sleep\fP
.sp
Sets the number of seconds to wait after a failed base backup copy before retrying.
Default is \fB30\fP seconds. Must be a non\-negative integer.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

This applies to both backup and recovery operations.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBbasebackup_retry_times\fP
.sp
Defines the number of retry attempts for a base backup copy after an error occurs.
Default is \fB0\fP (no retries). Must be a non\-negative integer.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This applies to both backup and recovery operations.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.sp
\fBcheck_timeout\fP
.sp
Sets the maximum execution time in seconds for a Barman check command per server. Set
to \fB0\fP to disable the timeout. Default is \fB30\fP seconds. Must be a non\-negative
integer.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBcluster\fP
.sp
Tag the server or model to an associated cluster name. Barman uses this association to
override configuration for all servers/models in this cluster. If omitted for servers,
it defaults to the server\(aqs name.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Must be specified for configuration models to group applicable servers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Scope: Server / Model.
.sp
\fBconfig_changes_queue\fP
.sp
Designates the filesystem location for Barman\(aqs queue that handles configuration changes
requested via the barman \fBconfig\-update\fP command. This queue manages the
serialization and retry of configuration change requests. By default, Barman writes to
a file named \fBcfg_changes.queue\fP under \fBbarman_home\fP\&.
.sp
Scope: Global.
.sp
\fBconfiguration_files_directory\fP
.sp
Designates the directory where server/model configuration files will be read by Barman.
Defaults to \fB/etc/barman.d/\fP\&.
.sp
Scope: Global.
.sp
\fBconninfo\fP
.sp
Specifies the connection string used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server.
This is a libpq connection string. Commonly used keys include: \fBhost\fP, \fBhostaddr\fP,
\fBport\fP, \fBdbname\fP, \fBuser\fP and \fBpassword\fP\&. See the
\X'tty: link https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING'\fI\%PostgreSQL documentation\fP\X'tty: link'
for details.
.sp
Scope: Server / Model.
.sp
\fBcreate_slot\fP
.sp
Determines whether Barman should automatically create a replication slot if it\(aqs not
already present for streaming WAL files. When set to \fBauto\fP and \fBslot_name\fP is
defined, Barman will attempt to create the slot automatically. When set to \fBmanual\fP
(default), the replication slot must be created manually.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBdescription\fP
.sp
Provides a human\-readable description of a server.
.sp
Scope: Server / Model.
.sp
\fBerrors_directory\fP
.sp
The directory where WAL files that were errored while being archived by Barman are
stored. This includes duplicate WAL files (e.g., an archived WAL file that has already
been streamed but have different hash) and unexpected files found in the WAL archive
directory.
.sp
The purpose of placing the files in this directory is so someone can later review why they
failed to be archived and take appropriate actions (dispose of, store somewhere else,
replace the duplicate file archived before, etc.)
.sp
Scope: Server.
.sp
\fBforward_config_path\fP
.sp
Determines whether a passive node should forward its configuration file path to its
primary node during \fBcron\fP or \fBsync\-info\fP commands. Set to \fBtrue\fP if Barman is
invoked with the \fB\-c\fP / \fB\-\-config\fP option and the configuration paths are identical
on both passive and primary Barman servers. Defaults to \fBfalse\fP\&.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBimmediate_checkpoint\fP
.sp
Controls how Postgres handles checkpoints at the start of a backup. Set to \fBfalse\fP
(default) to allow the checkpoint to complete according to
\fBcheckpoint_completion_target\fP\&. Set to \fBtrue\fP for an immediate checkpoint, where
Postgres completes the checkpoint as quickly as possible.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBkeepalive_interval\fP
.sp
Sets the interval in seconds for sending a heartbeat query to keep the libpq
connection active during an rsync backup. Default is \fB60\fP seconds. Setting this to
\fB0\fP disables the heartbeat.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBlock_directory_cleanup\fP
.sp
Enables automatic cleanup of unused lock files in the \fBbarman_lock_directory\fP\&.
.sp

.sp
\fBminimum_redundancy\fP
.sp
Specifies the minimum number of backups to retain. Default is \fB0\fP\&.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.
.sp
\fBmodel\fP
.sp
When set to \fBtrue\fP, turns a server section from a configuration file into a model for
a cluster. There is no \fBfalse\fP option in this case. If you want to simulate a
\fBfalse\fP option, comment out (\fB#model=true\fP) or remove the option in the
configuration. Defaults to the server name.
.sp
Scope: Model.
.sp
\fBnetwork_compression\fP
.sp
Enables or disables data compression for network transfers. Set to \fBfalse\fP (default)
to disable compression, or \fBtrue\fP to enable it and reduce network usage.
.sp
Scope: Global / Server / Model.

.SH CONFIGURATION MODELS
.sp
Configuration models provide a systematic approach to manage and apply configuration
overrides for Postgres servers by organizing them under a specific \fBcluster\fP name.
.SS Purpose
.sp
The primary goal of a configuration model is to simplify the management of configuration
settings for Postgres servers grouped by the same \fBcluster\fP\&. By using a model, you can
apply a set of common configuration overrides, enhancing operational efficiency. They are
especially beneficial in clustered environments, allowing you to create various
configuration models that can be utilized during failover events.
.SS Application
.sp
The configurations defined in a model file can be applied to Postgres servers that share
the same \fBcluster\fP name specified in the model. Consequently, any server utilizing that
model can inherit these settings, promoting a consistent and adaptable configuration
across all servers.
.SS Usage
.sp
Model options can only be defined within a model section, which is identified in the same
way as a server section. It is important to ensure that there are no conflicts between
the identifiers of server sections and model sections.
.sp
To apply a configuration model, execute the
\fBbarman config\-switch SERVER_NAME MODEL_NAME\fP\&. This command facilitates the application
of the model\(aqs overrides to the relevant Barman server associated with the specified
cluster name.
.sp
If you wish to remove the overrides, the deletion of the model configuration file alone
will not have any effect, so you can do so by using the \fB\-\-reset\fP argument with the
command, as follows: \fBbarman config\-switch SERVER_NAME \-\-reset\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBconfig\-switch\fP command will only succeed if model name exists and is associated
with the same \fBcluster\fP as the server. Additionally, there can be only one active
model at a time; if you execute the command multiple times with different models, only
the overrides defined in the last model will be applied.
.sp
Not all options can be configured through models. Please review the scope of the
available configurations to determine which settings apply to models.
