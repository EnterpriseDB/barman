.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Execute a PostreSQL server restore operation. Barman will restore the backup from a
server in the destination directory. The restoration can be performed locally (on the
barman node itself) or remotely (on another machine accessible via SSH). The location is
determined by whether or not the \fB\-\-remote\-ssh\-command\fP option is used. More
information on this command can be found in the \fI\%Recovery\fP section. You can use a
shortcut instead of \fBBACKUP_ID\fP\&.
.SH PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBSERVER_NAME\fP
Name of the server in barman node
.TP
.B \fBBACKUP_ID\fP
Id of the backup in the barman catalog. Use \fBauto\fP to have Barman automatically
find the most suitable backup for the restore operation.
.TP
.B \fBDESTINATION_DIR\fP
Destination directory to restore the backup.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-aws\-region\fP
Specify the AWS region where the instance and disks for snapshot recovery are
located. This option allows you to override the \fBaws_region\fP value in the Barman
configuration.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-azure\-resource\-group\fP
Specify the Azure resource group containing the instance and disks for snapshot
recovery. This option allows you to override the \fBazure_resource_group\fP value in
the Barman configuration.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-bwlimit\fP
Specify the maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per second. A value of \fB0\fP
indicates no limit. This setting overrides the \fBbandwidth_limit\fP configuration
option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-exclusive\fP
Set target (time, XID or LSN) to be non inclusive.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gcp\-zone\fP
Specify the GCP zone where the instance and disks for snapshot recovery are located.
This option allows you to override the \fBgcp_zone\fP value in the Barman
configuration.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-get\-wal\fP / \fB\-\-no\-get\-wal\fP
Enable/disable usage of \fBget\-wal\fP for WAL fetching during recovery. Default is based on
\fBrecovery_options\fP setting.
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fP / \fB\-\-help\fP
Show a help message and exit. Provides information about command usage.
.TP
.B \fB\-j\fP / \fB\-\-jobs\fP
Specify the number of parallel workers to use for copying files during the backup.
This setting overrides the \fBparallel_jobs\fP parameter if it is specified in the
configuration file.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jobs\-start\-batch\-period\fP
Specify the time period, in seconds, for starting a single batch of jobs. This value
overrides the \fBparallel_jobs_start_batch_period\fP parameter if it is set in the
configuration file. The default is \fB1\fP second.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jobs\-start\-batch\-size\fP
Specify the maximum number of parallel workers to initiate in a single batch. This
value overrides the \fBparallel_jobs_start_batch_size\fP parameter if it is defined in
the configuration file. The default is \fB10\fP workers.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-local\-staging\-path\fP
Specify path on the Barman host where the chain of backups will be combined before
being copied to the destination directory. The contents created within the staging
path will be removed upon completion of the restore process. This option is
necessary for restoring from block\-level incremental backups and has no effect
otherwise.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-network\-compression\fP / \fB\-\-no\-network\-compression\fP
Enable/disable network compression during remote restore. Default is based on
\fBnetwork_compression\fP configuration setting.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-retry\fP
There will be no retry in case of an error. It is the same as setting
\fB\-\-retry\-times 0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-recovery\-conf\-filename\fP
Specify the name of the file where Barman should write recovery options when
recovering backups for Postgres versions 12 and later. By default, this is set to
\fBpostgresql.auto.conf\fP\&. However, if \fB\-\-recovery\-conf\-filename\fP is specified,
recovery options will be written to the specified value instead. While the default
value is suitable for most Postgres installations, this option allows you to specify
an alternative location if Postgres is managed by tools that alter the configuration
mechanism (for example, if \fBpostgresql.auto.conf\fP is symlinked to \fB/dev/null\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-recovery\-staging\-path\fP
Specify a path on the recovery host where files for a compressed backup will be
staged before being uncompressed to the destination directory. Backups will be
staged in their own directory within the staging path, following the naming
convention: \fBbarman\-staging\-SERVER_NAME\-BACKUP_ID\fP\&. This staging directory will be
removed after the restore process is complete. This option is mandatory for
restoring from compressed backups and has no effect otherwise.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-remote\-ssh\-command\fP
This option enables remote restore by specifying the secure shell command to
execute on a remote host. It functions similarly to the \fBssh_command\fP server
option in the configuration file for remote restore, that is, \fB\(aqssh USER@SERVER\(aq\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-retry\-sleep\fP
Specify the number of seconds to wait after a failed copy before retrying. This
setting applies to both backup and restore operations and overrides the
\fBbasebackup_retry_sleep\fP parameter if it is defined in the configuration file.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-retry\-times\fP
Specify the number of times to retry the base backup copy in case of an error. This
applies to both backup and restore operations and overrides the
\fBbasebackup_retry_times\fP parameter if it is set in the configuration file.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-snapshot\-recovery\-instance\fP
Specify the name of the instance where the disks recovered from the snapshots are
attached. This option is necessary when recovering backups created with
\fBbackup_method=snapshot\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-snapshot\-recovery\-zone\fP (deprecated)
Zone containing the instance and disks for the snapshot recovery (deprecated:
replaced by \fB\-\-gcp\-zone\fP)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-standby\-mode\fP
Whether to start the Postgres server as a standby.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tablespace\fP
Specify tablespace relocation rule. \fBNAME\fP is the tablespace name and \fBLOCATION\fP
is the recovery host destination path to restore the tablespace.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-action\fP
Trigger the specified action when the recovery target is reached. This option
requires defining a target along with one of these actions. The possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpause\fP: Once recovery target is reached, the server is started in pause state,
allowing users to inspect the instance
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpromote\fP: Once recovery target is reached, the server will exit the recovery
operation and is promoted as a master.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBshutdown\fP: Once recovery target is reached, the server is shut down.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-immediate\fP
Recovery is completed when a consistent state is reached (end of the base backup).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-lsn\fP
Recover to the specified LSN (Log Sequence Number). Requires Postgres 10 or above.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-name\fP
Recover to the specified name of a restore point previously created with the
\fBpg_create_restore_point(name)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-time\fP
Recover to the specified time. Use the format \fBYYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-tli\fP
Recover the specified timeline. You can use the special values \fBcurrent\fP and
\fBlatest\fP in addition to a numeric timeline ID. For Postgres versions 12 and above,
the default is to recover to the latest timeline in the WAL archive. For Postgres
versions below 12, the default is to recover to the timeline that was current at the
time the backup was taken.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\-xid\fP
Recover to the specified transaction ID.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-staging\-wal\-directory\fP
A staging directory on the destination host for WAL files when performing PITR. If
unspecified, it uses a \fBbarman_wal\fP directory inside the destination directory.
.UNINDENT
