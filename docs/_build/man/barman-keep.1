.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Mark the specified backup with a \fBtarget\fP as an archival backup to be retained
indefinitely, overriding any active retention policies. You can also check the keep
\fBstatus\fP of a backup and \fBrelease\fP the keep mark from a backup. You can use a
shortcut instead of \fBBACKUP_ID\fP\&.
.SH PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBSERVER_NAME\fP
Name of the server in barman node
.TP
.B \fBBACKUP_ID\fP
Id of the backup in barman catalog.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-release\fP
Release the keep mark from this backup. This will remove its archival status and
make it available for deletion, either directly or by retention policy.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-status\fP
Report the archival status of the backup. The status will be either \fBfull\fP or
\fBstandalone\fP for archival backups, or \fBnokeep\fP for backups that have not been
designated as archival.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-target\fP
Define the recovery target for the archival backup. The possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfull\fP: The backup can be used to recover to the most recent point in time. To
support this, Barman will keep all necessary WALs to maintain the backup\(aqs
consistency as well as any subsequent WALs.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstandalone\fP: The backup can only be used to restore the server to its state at the
time of the backup. Barman will retain only the WALs required to ensure the
backup\(aqs consistency.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SHORTCUTS
.sp
Use shortcuts instead of \fBBACKUP_ID\fP\&.
