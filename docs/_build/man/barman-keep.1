.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Mark the specified backup with a \fBtarget\fP as an archival backup to be retained
indefinitely, overriding any active retention policies. You can also check the keep
\fBstatus\fP of a backup and \fBrelease\fP the keep mark from a backup. You can use a
shortcut instead of \fBBACKUP_ID\fP\&.

.TP
.B \fB\-s\fP / \fB\-\-status\fP
Report the archival status of the backup. The status will be either \fBfull\fP or
\fBstandalone\fP for archival backups, or \fBnokeep\fP for backups that have not been
designated as archival.

Define the recovery target for the archival backup. The possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0

consistency as well as any subsequent WALs.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstandalone\fP: The backup can only be used to restore the server to its state at the
