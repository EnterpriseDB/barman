\fBDescription\fP
.sp
The \fBbarman\-cloud\-backup\-delete\fP script is used to delete one or more backups created
with the \fBbarman\-cloud\-backup\fP command from cloud storage and to remove the associated
WAL files.
.sp
Backups can be specified for deletion either by their backup ID
(as obtained from \fBbarman\-cloud\-backup\-list\fP) or by a retention policy. Retention
policies mirror those used by the Barman server, deleting all backups that are not required to
meet the specified policy. When a backup is deleted, any unused WAL files associated with
that backup are also removed.
.sp
WALs are considered unused if:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The WALs predate the begin_wal value of the oldest remaining backup.
.IP \(bu 2
The WALs are not required by any archival backups stored in the cloud.

For GCP, only authentication with \fBGOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\fP env is supported.
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each backup deletion involves three separate requests to the cloud provider: one for
the backup files, one for the \fBbackup.info\fP file, and one for the associated WALs.
Deleting by retention policy may result in a high volume of delete requests if a
large number of backups are accumulated in cloud storage.
