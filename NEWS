Version 1.0.0 - 6 July 2012

* Backup of multiple PostgreSQL servers, with different versions. Versions
  from PostgreSQL 8.4+ are supported.

* Support for secure remote backup (through SSH)

* Management of a catalog of backups for every server, allowing users
  to easily create new backups, delete old ones or restore them

* Compression of WAL files that can be configured on a per server
  basis using compression/decompression filters, both predefined (gzip
  and bzip2) or custom

* Support for INI configuration file with global and per-server directives.
  Default location for configuration files are /etc/barman.conf or
  ~/.barman.conf. The '-c' option allows users to specify a different one

* Simple indexing of base backups and WAL segments that does not require
  a local database

* Maintenance mode (invoked through the 'cron' command) which performs
  ordinary operations such as WAL archival and compression, catalog
  updates, etc.

* Added the 'backup' command which takes a full physical base backup
  of the given PostgreSQL server configured in Barman

* Added the 'recover' command which performs local recovery of a given
  backup, allowing DBAs to specify a point in time. The 'recover' command
  supports relocation of both the PGDATA directory and, where applicable,
  the tablespaces

* Added the '--remote-ssh-command' option to the 'recover' command for
  remote recovery of a backup. Remote recovery does not currently support
  relocation of tablespaces

* Added the 'list-server' command that lists all the active servers
  that have been configured in barman

* Added the 'show-server' command that shows the relevant information
  for a given server, including all configuration options

* Added the 'status' command which shows information about the current
  state of a server, including Postgres version, current transaction ID,
  archive command, etc.

* Added the 'check' command which returns 0 if everything Barman needs
  is functioning correctly

* Added the 'list-backup' command that lists all the available backups
  for a given server, including size of the base backup and total size
  of the related WAL segments

* Added the 'show-backup' command that shows the relevant information
  for a given backup, including time of start, size, number of related
  WAL segments and their size, etc.

* Added the 'delete' command which removes a backup from the catalog

* Added the 'list-files' command which lists all the files for a
  single backup

* RPM Package for RHEL 5/6
