	Prepared release 1.6.1

2016-05-16  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Clarify switch-xlog and replication-status failure output
	Change the output messages to be more clear regarding the cause of the
	failure.

2016-05-12  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Fix traceback for switch-xlog with unknown server

2016-05-09  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Avoid logging tracebacks during WAL files deletion
	During WAL files deletion, if the target file doesn't exists,
	print a WARNING message and continue.

2016-05-06  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Update the ChangeLog file

	Prepared version 1.6.1a1

2016-05-06  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix "PostgreSQL connection forced cleanup message" during unit tests

2016-05-06  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Modify manifest to include tutorial file in dist tar.

2016-05-06  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Rolling out 1.6.1a1

	Add "replication-status" command
	The "replication-status" command shows live information
	and status of any streaming client attached to one or more
	given servers.

	The --target option allows users to limit the scope to
	only hot standby servers ('hot-standby') or WAL streaming
	clients, such as pg_receivexlog ('wal-streamer'). By default,
	--target is set to 'all'.

2016-05-05  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Check for 'backup_label' on the master
	If a PostgreSQL server is abruptly shut down when an
	exclusive backup is in progress, the 'backup_label' file
	will stay inside PGDATA.

	In case of a failed exclusive backup, if the Postgres server
	is down, "barman check" verifies that a backup_label is present.
	If so, prints "A 'backup_label' is present".

	Fixes #69

2016-05-04  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add check for empty WAL archive
	Add a check, visible in the check output only if fails, that war the
	user about a bad configuration of WAL shipping checking the dimension of
	the xlog.db file.

2016-05-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add implementation of the switch-xlog command
	Implement the switch-xlog command that invokes
	pg_switch_xlog() on one or any PostgreSQL server.

	A --force option issues a CHECKPOINT just before the
	execution of the switch, forcing the server to generate
	a new WAL file.

2016-05-05  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Avoid logging a traceback during check with wrong ssh_command
	If ssh_command does not exists avoid logging an exception during checks
	with PostgreSQL versions older than 9.4

2016-05-02  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add `streaming_archiver_name` option
	When `streaming_archiver` is enabled, the `streaming_archiver_name`
	option properly sets the `application_name` of the managed `pg_receivexlog`
	process, improving monitoring of physical streaming replication clients.
	By default, `streaming_archiver_name` is set to `barman_receive_wal`.

	Available for PostgreSQL 9.3 and above.

	Remove redundant initial assignment

2016-04-28  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add reference to external project BarmanAPI

	Use absolute unit values in pretty_size()

2016-04-12  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Avoid crashing with a malformed conninfo parameter
	When a connection fails, prepend the error message with the connnection
	type ('conninfo' or 'streaming_conninfo').

2016-04-09  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix usage of the --dbname option.
	The --dbname option is available only from version 9.3 of pg_receivexlog.
	This patch fixes the wal_archiver module, forcing barman when
	pg_receivexlog version is <= 9.2 to split the
	conninfo parameter.

	Fixes #36

2016-04-05  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add timestamp and exit code to barman-wal-restore output

2016-04-01  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Make sure PostgreSQL connections are cleanly closed
	Modified the cli module to wrap every Server's top level command
	in a closing(server) context.

	Added also an atexit handler which logs a warning for stale connections.

	During backup command, the PostgreSQL connections are closed as soon as
	they are no longer needed.

2016-03-15  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@gmail.com>

	Make Barman unit tests remove temporary folders
	During the recovery executor unit tests, Barman was leaving a few
	temporary folders.

	This patch makes the unit tests remove them and covers a few corner
	cases where Barman, in consequence of a command failure, was not
	deleting the temporary folders.

2016-03-16  Rubens Souza  <rubens.souza@2ndquadrant.it>

	Minor change in man page for streaming_conninfo

	Mark "failed backups" check as non-fatal
	Allow taking a new backup in case of presence of failed backups.
	This bug was introduced in version 1.6.0.

2016-03-11  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Rename '-x' get-wal option as '-z'
	The old '-x' remains as a deprecated undocumented alias.

2016-03-10  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add archive_mode=always support for PostgreSQL 9.5
	This patch adds a basic archive_mode=always support for PostgreSQL
	9.5. This archive mode is simply considered equal to "on".

	Thanks to Koichi Suzuki for opening a bug and proposing a fix.

	Fixes #32

2016-03-07  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	* Add a related check for the server

	Closes #30

2016-02-26  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add `--peek SIZE` option to `barman get-wal`
	When the `--peek SIZE` option is passed to `get-wal`, it will peek from
	the WAL archive the requested WAL file as well as subsequent files.
	'SIZE' must be an integer >= 1. When invoked with this option, get-wal
	returns a list of zero to 'SIZE' WAL segment names, one per row.

2016-03-01  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Refine dependencies on external software
	Barman requires psycopg2 >= 2.4.2 to support streaming archiving

2016-02-11  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Make the code compatible with Python >= 3.2
	All the incompatible constructs were rewritten to support both Python 2.x
	and 3.x. Previously we were running 2to3 during the setup execution.

	Add Leonardo Cecchi to authors

2016-02-15  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Rollback transaction after starting a backup
	Following the complete refactoring of the PostgreSQL connection code,
	part of this 1.6.0 previous versions (alpha1, beta1 and beta2),
	Barman is keeping an IDLE connection while taking a backup.
	This could trigger spurious alerts if a transaction has been left open.

2016-02-12  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add 'receive-wal running' check
	When `streaming_archiver` is enabled, this check ensures that
	a `receive-wal` process is running.

2016-02-12  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add --reset option to receive-wal comand
	Add the `--reset` option to the `receive-wal` command, allowing
	users to reset the WAL location of the streaming archiver.
	This is useful in case Barman goes out of sync with the master
	server.

2016-02-10  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Update the ChangeLog file

2016-02-08  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Complete integration of RemoteStatusMixin class
	Let classes implementing the the get_remote_status method inherit
	from the RemoteStatusMixin base class, completing the refactoring
	activity started with a previous commit (3179a1e).

2016-02-08  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix unwanted removal of duplicate WAL from archive
	This commit removes an unused and dangerous option from the Compressor
	interface that allowed the removal of the source WAL file after
	compression (introduced in 1.6.0 development branch).

	Fixes: #27

	Remove trashing of old WAL files from the archiver
	The archiver now always archives any file with a valid name that
	finds inside the incoming directory.

	NOTE: The block of code that has been removed changes behaviour
	of existing Barman installations, but in a conservative way.
	We defer to future versions of Barman to better understand
	WAL files' sequentiality (parsing history files, for example),
	by writing specific classes/modules responsible for deeper
	and more robust checks in the archive area.

2016-02-05  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Manage the termination of receive-wal in cron
	When the 'streaming_archive' option is disabled for a server,
	a cron execution makes sure that a running receive-wal process
	is correctly terminated.

	Clearer output and logging messages for `receive-wal`.

2016-02-05  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add check for archiver errors
	Barman now checks for the presence of files in the error directory.

2016-02-04  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improve error handling when required server parameters are missing
	Add error handling in case a required parameter (i.e. ssh_command,
	conninfo, ...) is missing, by emitting meaningful error messages.

2016-02-02  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Adjust severity of some messages produced by cron command
	The messages about subprocess execution produced by the cron command
	were emitted for every cron run. They provide little information and
	their presence may make the log difficult to analyse, so they have been
	removed from log.

	Add --stop option to receive-wal command
	Add the option --stop to the receive-wal command, allowing the user to
	stop a receive-wal process that running in background for a specific server.

	The implementation is based on the new class ProcessManager that will be
	used in the future to manage all barman's sub-processes.

	Improve archive-wal robustness and log messages
	Display clearer error messages when discarding a WAL file.
	Also, WAL files that are older than the first backup are

	Implement pygzip and pybzip2 compressors
	The new pygzip and pybzip2 compressors are implemented using Python's
	internal modules for compressing and decompressing gzip and bzip2 files.
	This avoids the cost of forking and executing the shell.

	Initial idea by Christoph Moench-Tegeder <cmt@2ndquadrant.de>

	Update copyright years to 2016

2016-01-08  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add 'receive-wal' cron integration
	Add integration of the new command 'receive-wal' during the execution of
	the cron command.

	If the option 'streaming_archiver' is on, the command 'receive-wal' is
	automatically executed as subprocess by the cron command, allowing
	Barman to receive WAL files from PostgreSQL using the native streaming
	protocol.

	TODO: Implement a way to interrupt a running streaming process

2015-12-09  Stefano Zacchiroli  <zack@upsilon.cc>

	Add support for the pigz compressor
	Pigz on-disk format is the same of gzip, but (de)compression is much
	faster due to the usage of CPU parallelism.

	For write-intense workloads pigz vs gzip might make the difference,
	between struggling to keep up with archiving incoming WALs and being
	able to keep up easily.

2016-01-09  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add check() method in WalArchiver classes
	Move code from the server.check_postgres() method in
	the WalArchiver class, so that each implementation (FileWalArchiver
	and StreamingArchiver) perform their specific checks.
	Created the RemoteStatusMixin class that implements a cacheable
	version of remote status information.

	Currently it is only used by the WalArchiver class tree.
	TODO: propagate it to all other classes implementing the
	get_remote_status() function in a later commit.

2016-01-08  Christoph Moench-Tegeder  <christoph@2ndquadrant.de>

	Permit `archive_mode=always` for 9.5 servers
	PostgreSQL 9.5 introduces archive_mode=always. Even though Barman's
	current framework for checks does not allow yet to correctly monitor
	archiving from standby servers, Barman now allows users to set
	`archive_mode` to `always`, provided that archiving happens from the master.

2016-01-08  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix server creation and output of check command
	Modified the init method of Server Object, managing errors/exception
	using the msg_list attribute of the configuration.
	Modified the check command output.

2016-01-04  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Rename get_first_backup and get_last_backup methods
	Renamed get_first_backup() and get_last_backup() methods of the
	Server and BackupManager classes, respectively into get_first_backup_id()
	and get_last_backup_id(), for coherence and code clarity.
	Now the fact that the method returns the ID of a backup instead
	of a BackupInfo object has been made explicit.

	Fix management of backup id during backup deletion
	Fix an error that prevents the deletion of an existing
	backup while a backup on the same server is in progress.

	Fixes #22

2015-12-31  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Use isort python package to keep imports ordered

2015-12-14  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Implement `receive-wal` command
	The `receive-wal` command receives the stream of transaction logs for a
	server. The process relies on `pg_receivexlog` to receive WAL files from
	a PostgreSQL server through the streaming protocol.
	It is a foreground process which lasts until it receives a SIGINT.

2015-12-31  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add support for long running Commands
	The Command class now supports the execution of long running
	subprocesses, by passing the subprocess output and error streams
	to a handler, line by line.

	Remove spurious newlines from log lines
	Error messages coming from libpq often terminate with a newline.
	Always call strip() on strings that have been extracted from
	exceptions before logging them.

	Make get_remote_status methods behaviour coherent
	A 'get_remote_status' method should never raise an exception in case of
	error. The expected behaviour is to set missing values to None in the
	resulting dictionary.

2015-12-29  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix exception when streaming connection is unavailable
	Previously, when 'streaming_archiver' was on and pg_receivexlog correctly
	installed, Barman would raise an AttributeError exception when streaming
	connection to PostgreSQL was unavailable, as it could not detect the
	server version.

	This commit fixes the error by modifying the management of a failed
	connection to PostgreSQL through streaming connection. It also adds
	an unit test for this scenario, as well as hints for the user during
	`barman check` suggesting a possible streaming connection error.

2015-12-28  Leonardo Cecchi  <leonardo.cecchi@2ndquadrant.it>

	Propagate "-c" option to any Barman subprocess
	The "-c" option lets users specify a custom location for the configuration
	file. It must be propagated to every Barman subprocess for consistency
	of behaviour.

	Fixes #19

2015-12-24  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Update documentation about WAL archiving

2015-12-22  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Manage WAL duplicates in `archive-wal` command
	In case a WAL file is archived twice, `archive-wal` will check
	if the new file is identical to the already archived one (compressed
	WAL files will be decompressed and checked). If yes, the second
	file is discarded, otherwise it is saved in the 'errors' directory.

	Accept compressed WAL files in incoming directory
	In case a WAL file in the incoming directory is already compressed
	using a known algorithm, archive it as is.

	Add streaming support to 'archive-wal' command
	The `archive-wal` command now looks for both archived WAL files
	(shipped from PostgreSQL through its `archive_command`) and streamed
	ones (via the `receive-wal` command).

2015-12-24  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add sleep time option to `barman-wal-restore` script
	Introduce the '-s seconds' option to the barman-wal-restore script.
	After a failure of the get-wal command, the script will sleep for
	the specified amount of seconds (default 0, no wait) before
	exiting the restore_command from PostgreSQL.

	Closes #7

2015-12-22  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add `streaming_wals_directory` and `errors_directory` options

2015-12-06  Christoph Moench-Tegeder  <cmt@2ndquadrant.com>

	Remove redundant sete[gu]id() calls
	Python's documentation of the os.setuid/os.setgid calls is
	oversimplified to the point of being wrong. Under the hood,
	the setuid(2)/setgid(2) functions are used, thus making these
	calls as POSIX compliant as the underlying operating system.
	As barman won't be installed SUID (it's an interpreter file),
	effective, real and saved user id should always be the same.
	That way, the only reason to use setuid() family calls at all
	is for a privileged user (root) to change over to the barman
	(unprivileged) user. According to POSIX.1-2013, the setuid()
	call changes all three (real, effective and saved) uids if
	called by a privileged user (the same holds for setgid() and
	the group ids). In this construct, the additional seti[gu]id
	calls are redundant no-ops and can be removed.

2015-11-27  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add support for 'streaming_archiver' option
	Add a global/server boolean option called 'streaming_archiver' which
	enables the use of the PostgreSQL's streaming protocol to receive
	transaction logs from a server.
	If set to 'on', Barman expects to find `pg_receivexlog` in the PATH
	(see `path` option) and that streaming connection for the server is
	properly working. Subsequently, it activates both proper connection
	checks and management of WAL files.

	Refactored the code to use a new class, the StreamingWalArchiver,
	which is responsible for managing WAL files using a streaming
	connection.

	Add support for 'archiver' option
	Add a global/server boolean option called 'archiver' which
	enables continuous WAL archiving (through log shipping using
	PostgreSQL's archive_command) for a specific server.
	If set the 'true' (default), Barman expects that PostgreSQL
	continously deposits WAL files in the 'incoming' directory
	of that server, and subsequently activates proper checks and
	management.

	Refactored the code to use a new class, the FileWalArchiver.
	The class is in charge of both archival and compression of WAL files.
	This is the first step towards the implementation of streaming
	archiving support.

	Reorder constants in barman.config module

2015-11-20  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add `streaming_conninfo` server option
	Added the `streaming_conninfo` option to Barman configuration.
	This option (with server scope only), adds the support in Barman
	for a streaming replication connection to a PostgreSQL server.

	Added also a simple check for the barman check command, that tests
	that the streaming connection to PostgreSQL is properly working.

2015-11-13  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add support for `path_prefix` configuration option
	The `path_prefix` global/server option can contain one
	or more absolute paths, separated by colon, where Barman
	looks for executable files.

	The paths specified in `path_prefix` are tried before the
	ones specified in `PATH` environment variable.

2015-11-10  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Refactored access to PostgreSQL
	Created the 'postgres' module which is responsible for any communication
	with a PostgreSQL server, wrapping all connection and query management
	activities. This module is the only point of access to PostgreSQL.

2015-11-06  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Rename `copy_method` configuration key to `backup_method`

2015-11-03  Giuseppe Broccolo  <giuseppe.broccolo@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Create an implicit restore point at the end of a backup
	At the end of a backup, if the PostgreSQL version is 9.1 or newer,
	create an implicit restore point using the pg_create_restore_point()
	function.

2015-11-11  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Set version to 1.6.0a1

2015-11-13  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Update the ChangeLog file

	Prepared version 1.5.1

2015-11-13  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Create pg_xlog/archive_status directory at the end of recovery
	On PostgreSQL 8.3, the pg_xlog/archive_status directory is not
	automatically created, if missing, during the startup. To avoid errors
	Barman now creates that directory at the end of any recovery operation.

2015-11-13  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Converted sphinx directory README to Markdown

2015-11-10  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Pin (temporarily) pytest-catchlog to version 1.1
	The pytest-catchlog release 1.2.0 broke Python 2.6 compatibility, so pin
	the 1.1 version until it will be restored.

	Ref: https://github.com/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog/pull/15

	In latest release of pytest-catchlog the result of caplog.records() call
	is a copy of the event list so any modification of that has no global
	effect. Change the code that uses caplog.records() to not rely on the
	previous undocumented behaviour.

2015-11-05  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

2015-11-04  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Update the ChangeLog file

	Avoid forcing arcfour cypher in barman-wal-restore
	OpenSSH 6.7 dropped many low security algorithms, and arcfour is one of
	them. So we stop forcing it in the script, allowing the user to define
	the wanted algorithm in ~/.ssh/config

	Ref: http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.7

	Revert version to 1.5 branch due to relevant bug fixing

2015-10-12  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add the 'archive-wal' command
	The 'archive-wal' command executes the WAL maintenance operations on a
	given server.

	This command is automatically executed as a subprocess by the cron
	command, allowing the parallel execution of WAL archiving on
	different servers.

2015-10-20  Giuseppe Broccolo  <giuseppe.broccolo@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Avoid 'wal_level' check on PostgreSQL version < 9.0
	Conditionally skip 'wal_level' check in PostgreSQL
	versions prior to 9.0.

	Fixes #3

	Avoid retention policy checks during the recovery
	Additionally, skip any missing tablespace directory during the deletion
	of a backup (like we already do with missing pgdata directory)

2015-10-20  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix more incorrect mock assert calls in unit tests
	Add flake8-mock plugin in flake8 tox environment to make sure it will
	not happen again.

	Some more cleanup of testing infrastructure has been done:

	* Switch from pytest-capturelog (unresponsive upstream) to
	  pytest-catchlog.
	* Remove the version pinning from mock as 1.3.0 supports py2.6 again.
	* Add flake8-copyright and flake8-string-format plugins.

2015-10-09  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Allow parallel cron execution for different servers
	Allow the execution of multiple 'barman cron' processes, each one
	handling a different server. Servers will be handled sequentially,
	skipping those that are already being served by another cron process.

2015-10-22  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix calculation of backup size
	In Barman 1.5.0 the internal directory structure of a backup has been
	changed, moving tablespaces from being inside the data directory to
	being inside the backup directory. The method backup_fsync_and_set_sizes()
	now takes that into account by running against the whole backup directory.

	Fixes #5

2015-10-12  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix some incorrect mock assert calls in unit tests

2015-10-06  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for mixed compression types in WAL files (#61)
	Decompress each WAL file using the specific algorithm
	reported in the XLOG archive (xlogdb).

	Improve management of xlog.db errors
	Better management of errors during the decoding of the name
	of an xlog segment. Added a hint that suggests to run
	"barman rebuild-xlogdb" to fix corruptions in the xlogdb file.

2015-10-02  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add barman-wal-restore script
	Add a simple bash script to be used as `restore_command`
	in a standby scenario, as fallback method. The script
	uses ssh to connect to the Barman server and requests
	the required WAL file for recovery.

	The script checks that destination path is not a directory.

2015-08-27  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Convert tutorial to Markdown

2015-08-28  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Manage options without '=' in PostgreSQL configuration files

2015-08-18  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Allow 'pre' retry hook scripts to stop the command
	Add EXIT_ABORT_STOP (63) and EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE (62) exit codes
	to control how a retry hook script is aborted.

	Termination of a retry hook script with EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE informs
	Barman to continue with its operations.

	By terminating a retry hook script with EXIT_ABORT_STOP, users
	request Barman to stop its main operation (i.e. backup or WAL archival).

	EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE is implemented by every retry hook script.

	EXIT_ABORT_STOP is currently implemented only with 'pre_backup_retry_script'
	and 'pre_archive_retry_script'.

	EXIT_ABORT_STOP is currently ignored by 'post_backup_retry_script' and
	'post_archive_retry_script', and its behaviour in these cases is
	identical to EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE.

2015-08-21  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add flake8 tox environment

2015-08-18  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Documentation for 'barman_lock_directory'

2015-08-18  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Analyse include directives for PostgreSQL
	Check if PostgreSQL administrators take advantage of include
	directives and specify additional files. Include directives
	(include, include_if_exists, include_dir) are not supported
	in Barman for files that reside outside PGDATA.

	During backup, warn users and list the files that require
	manual backup. During recovery, warn users about the presence
	of include directives in PostgreSQL configuration.

2015-08-18  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Workaround for rsync on SUSE Linux
	Many thanks to Christoph Moench-Tegeder <christoph@2ndquadrant.de>
	for his workaround proposal. This fixes the outstanding issue
	on SUSE Linux - previously raised by issues #13 and #26.
	See also: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898513

2015-08-17  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Added copy_method option (fixed to rsync)

2015-08-06  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for 'retry' hook scripts for backup and WAL archiving
	A 'retry' hook script is a special kind of hook scripts that Barman
	tries to run indefinitely until it either returns a SUCCESS (0) or
	an ABORT (63) exit code.

	Safe hook scripts are executed immediately before (pre) and after (post)
	the command execution. Standard hook scripts are executed immediately
	before (pre) and after (post) the retry hook scripts.

	This patch adds support for pre/post retry hook scripts for backup
	and WAL archiving.

	The following four global/server configuration options have been added:

	* pre_backup_retry_script: executed before a backup
	* post_backup_retry_script: executed after a backup
	* pre_archive_retry_script: executed before a WAL archive operation
	* post_archive_retry_script: executed after a WAL archive operation

	By default, no retry hook script is executed. Environment variables
	are identical to the equivalent standard hook script.

2015-08-12  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Updated AUTHORS file

2014-05-29  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for the 'get-wal' command
	The 'barman get-wal' command allows users to fetch any WAL file
	from the archive of a specific server in Barman.

2015-08-21  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add simple Travis CI integration

2015-07-30  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Preserve Timeline history files. Fixes #70.
	Added check for the management of history files during the removal of a
	backup or during normal maintenance operations (cron).

2015-08-06  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Forbid the delete of a running backup
	Block the execution of a barman delete command on a backup that is in progress.
	Use locks to ensure that there are no running backups on that server.
	Otherwise check for the position of the backup to be deleted in the
	catalogue and its status: if it is the first backup and its status is STARTED or EMPTY,
	the backup is running and delete is forbidden.

2015-08-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Follow symlinks when checking directory paths
	Check conflicting paths in configuration files using canonical paths and
	following symlinks when necessary.

2015-07-13  Francesco Canovai  <francesco.canovai@2ndquadrant.it>

	Pin mock==1.0.1 for testing.
	In version 1.1.x mock has changed some behaviours and is currently
	incompatible with our unit tests.

2015-07-08  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Execute check() before starting a backup
	Execute the full suite of tests from barman check command before
	starting a backup. Skip the execution of a backup in case check
	fails.

	Add a strategy for managing the results of the checks. Now every
	check is properly logged as error (failure) or debug (success).

2015-07-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

2015-07-01  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improved management of configuration in tests
	Improved and simplified the management of configurations in tests. Added
	a method for the creation of dictionaries containing all the keys that
	are usually present in a configuration. Updated tests accordingly.

2015-06-18  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Second part of the backup_executor module's refactor
	Refactored and streamlined the executor module. Introduced a specific
	class for physical backup with Rsync through Ssh, as well as a strategy
	pattern for the management of exclusive and concurrent backups (for
	backups from a standby).

2015-06-23  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Standard error management for server commands
	Standardised the process of managing errors with server commands in
	barman/cli.py. By default, inactive servers are skipped (without error)
	as well as temporarily disabled servers (with error). No distinction is
	made between calling a command with one server as target or with a list
	of them (including 'all'). Exceptions are check (no server is skipped,
	errors are returned only for active servers), cron (no error is ever
	returned), list-server and diagnose (both managing active/disabled
	servers with no errors). Inactive servers are the ones with 'active'
	option set to False. Disabled servers are the ones with internal
	directory conflicts (e.g. WALs directory = base backup directory).

2015-06-23  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Asciidoc support for man pages and tutorial

	Add check for wal_level
	For better usability, warn users about setting a proper value
	for wal_level setting in PostgreSQL.

2015-05-14  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add check for conflicting paths in Barman's configuration
	Added controls for path-clash during the creation of Barman servers.
	If there are conflicting paths, Barman will disable those servers
	containing errors.
	If a potentially destructive command like "backup" is issued on a server
	containing conflicts, Barman exits with an error message.

2015-05-21  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Complete refactor of the 'recover' command
	The main 'recover' command has been completely refactored, through
	the creation of a separate module, called 'recovery_executor'.
	The RecoveryExecutor class now embodies both local and remote
	operations, laying the road for future improvements.

	This patch also fixes #68, by disabling dangerous settings in
	postgresql.auto.conf (available from PostgreSQL 9.4).

	Basic unit tests have been added.

2015-05-19  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Rename class Server to ServerConfig in barman.config module
	Previously both barman.config and barman.server modules had a Server
	class. The former has now been renamed to ServerConfig, hence removing
	the ambiguity.

2015-03-24  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Improved cache management of backups
	Streamlined the management of the cache of the backups.
	It is now possible to register and remove a backup from the cache.
	The cache structure has been simplified and now it is a simple
	dictionary of backups. Status filters are applied by the
	get_available_backups() method.
	Managed registration and removal of a backup in the cache
	during backup operations.

2015-03-02  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Create backup_executor module and refactor backup.
	Extract all the methods relative to the execution of a backup into a
	dedicated object.
	The RsyncBackupExecutor encapsulates the operation of backing up a
	remote server using rsync and ssh to copy files.

2015-03-27  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improved management of xlogb file
	The xlogdb file is now correctly fsynced when updated.
	Also, the rebuild-xlogdb command now operates on a temporary
	new file, which overwrites the main one when finished.

2015-03-27  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add "active" configuration option for a server
	It is now possible to temporarily disable a server through
	the 'active' configuration option. Defined at server level
	as a boolean, when set to False the server is ignored by
	main operational commands such as cron, backup and recover.
	By default, it is set to True.

2015-03-20  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Modified Barman version following PEP 440 rules.
	Changed Barman version from 1.4.1-alpha1 to 1.4.1a1

	Adapted RPM build scripts to produce packages with
	the correct names.

2015-03-17  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fix computation of WAL production ratio
	The WAL file ratio reported in the 'show-backup' command output was wrong
	because it was considering only the number of WALS produced during the
	backup instead of the number of WALs produced until next backup.

2015-02-25  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fix for WAL archival stop working if first backup is EMPTY
	In some rare cases, if an empty backup has left by a failure during a
	backup, the cron could start trashing WAL files, as if there is no
	available backups.

	Closes: #64

2015-03-06  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Added 'barman_lock_directory' global option
	Barman now allows to specify the default directory for locks through
	the global option called 'barman_lock_directory', by default set to
	'barman_home'. Lock files will be created inside this directory.

	Names of lock files have been slightly changed. However, this won't
	affect users of Barman, unless you are relying on their locations and
	paths.

	This patch introduces four classes for managing lock files:
	GlobalCronLock, ServerBackupLock, ServerCronLock and ServerXLOGDBLock.

2015-02-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	New backup directory structure
	Inside the backup directory the 'pgdata' has been renamed to 'data'.
	Tablespaces, if present, are stored into individual directories alongside
	the 'data' directory.
	During backup and recovery operations, tablespaces are copied individually
	using a separate rsync command.

2015-01-11  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Store deduplication effects for incremental backup
	When incremental backup is enabled and uses hard links
	(reuse_backup = link), output of 'backup' command reports
	the effects of deduplication. The metrict is stored along
	the backup.info file in the 'deduplicated_size' field.

	IMPORTANT: this metric refers to the increment in size
	of the current backup from the previous backup and reflects
	only the situation at backup time.

2015-01-10  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

2014-12-22  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Unit tests for BackupInfo object

2014-12-24  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Change the way BackupInfo are created for testing

	Incremental base backup implementation
	Add support for reuse_backup global/server option, accepting
	three possible values:

	* off:  no incremental backup support (default)
	* copy: uses the last available backup as source (preventing unmodified
	        files from being copied)
	* link: same as copy but uses hard links on destination, if the filesystem
	        on the backup server allows it (reducing the occupied space)

	Add support for command line '--reuse-backup' option (default: link).

2014-12-24  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improve robustness of retention policy unit tests

2014-12-16  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fixes retention policies delete bug (#58)
	The method responsible for deleting obsolete backup in
	retention policies enforement, will not raise anymore
	the 'NoneType object is not iterable'. This prevents
	barman from terminating abruptly.

2014-11-28  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	stream with one which trows away averything it gets. Now it is not
	needed anymore because we haver a proper output module.

2014-09-26  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Remove all remaining output done by yield
	Migrate all the remaining part using yeld to do output to using the new
	output module.

2014-10-07  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Ignore fsync EINVAL errors on directories (#55)

2014-09-01  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Invoke WAL maintenance after a successful backup
	* At the end of the 'barman backup' command, maintenance operations
	  are automatically started for successful backups (equivalent to
	  manually executing a 'barman cron' command, just for that server)

	* Trashing of unuseful WALs (part of 'barman cron') has been changed
	  as follows:

	  * in case of one or more backups, delete WAL files older than
	    the start WAL of the first backup
	  * otherwise, trash WAL files in case of exclusive backup server
	    (that is, not concurrent)

2014-09-03  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Remove redundant server argument from HookScriptRunner.env_from_wal_info()

2014-08-27  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndquadrant.it>

	* Add 'relpath()' method to WalInfoFile, which returns the
	  relative path of a WAL file within the 'wals_directory' directory

2014-06-10  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for 'last_backup_max_age'
	This new global/server option allows administrators
	to set the max age of the last backup, making it easier
	to detect any issues with periodical backup execution.

2014-06-18  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for "smart" incremental recovery
	Avoid invoking rsync with --checksum option during recovery,
	while maintaining the same level of safety by splitting the
	copy operation in multiple steps.
	Barman will only use the --checksum option on files having identical
	time and size that have been modified after the start of the backup.
	This change greatly improves the speed of "incremental" recovery.

	Minor changes:
	- disable --checksum even for backup. During a backup the rsync
	  destination directory is empty, so it is safe to go with a plain
	  rsync
	- Put a ".barman-recover.info" with backup metadata inside the
	  destination directory during recover.

	Use Postgres' server time for both begin_time and end_time
	Minor changes:
	- make sure exceptions during backup are logged with stacktraces
	- commit on disk the backup status just after issuing the PostgreSQL
	  start_backup command

	Change version to 1.3.3-alpha.1

2014-06-09  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix for #43 recovery.conf not copied on remote recovery

2014-05-08  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Retry option for base backup
	If a network error happens during rsync, add the ability
	to retry a defined number of time.

	Two options have been added:
	 * basebackup_retry_times: INT (> 0, default 1)
	     maximum number or retry before giving up
	 * basebackup_retry_sleep: INT (> 0, default 10)
	     wait time (seconds) before retrying, after an error

	  rsync. This avoids overwrites by rsync when copying PGDATA content.
	* Add debug messages to FS class

	27: Addresses potential corruption of WAL xlog.db files.
	In barman.lockfile.release() the file is unlinked (deleted). This effectively
	nullifies any future attempts to lock the file by a blocking process by deleting
	the open file table entry upon which the flock is based.

	This commit removes the unlink and instead unlocks the file and then closes the file
	descriptor leaving the lock file and open file table entry intact.

	filenames may end in FF.

2012-12-08  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add retention status to show-backup and list-backup commands

	Auto-management of retention policies for base backups
	Using the report() method for retention policies, enforce retention
	policy through cron (if policy mode is 'auto'), by deleting OBSOLETE
	backups.

	Retention status and report() method for retention policies
	Created the following states for retention policies:
	VALID, OBSOLETE, NONE and POTENTIALLY_OBSOLETE (an
	object which is OBSOLETE but cannot be removed
	automatically due to minimum_redundancy requirements).
	Created the report() method for the retention policy
	base class, which exected the _backup_report() method
	for base backups and the _wal_report() method for WAL
	retention policies (currently not enforced).
	The report method iterates through the DONE backups
	and according to the retention policy, classifies
	the backup. RedundancyRetentionPolicy uses the number
	of backups, RecoveryWindowRetentionPolicy uses the
	time window and the recoverability point concept.

	Integrated minimum_redundancy with "barman check"

	Initialisation of retention policies for a server
	Added the _init_retention_policies() method in the
	Server class constructor, which integrates with
	the new RetentionPolicy classes and performs
	syntax checking.
	Integrated retention policies with log, 'barman check'
	and 'barman status'.

	String representation conforms to retention syntax
	The string representation produces now a syntax-valid
	retention policy configuration string.
	The previous __str__ method has been renamed into debug()
	SimpleWALRetentionPolicy objects are now created from
	the server's main retention policy by the factory class.

2012-12-07  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add the global/server option minimum_redundancy. Check it is >= 0. Guarantees that when delete is performed (or retention policies are enforced), this is the minimum number of backups to be kept for that server.

	Add support for retention_policy_mode global/server option which defines the method for enforcing retention policies (currently only "auto", in future versions "manual" will be allowed)

	Added first stub of retention policy classes

	Started version 1.2.0

2012-08-17  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add pre/post backup hook scripts definition (Closes: #7)
	Add the possibility to manage hook scripts before and after a base
	backup. Add the global (overridden per server) configuration options
	called:

	* pre_backup_script: executed before a backup
	* post_backup_script: executed after a backup

	Use the environment to pass at least the following variabiles:

	* BARMAN_BACKUP_DIR: backup destination directory
	* BARMAN_BACKUP_ID: ID of the backup
	* BARMAN_CONFIGURATION: configuration file used by barman
	* BARMAN_PHASE: 'pre' or 'post'
	* BARMAN_SERVER: name of the server

	The script definition is passed to the shell and can return any exit code.

	Barman won't perform any exit code check. It will simply log the result in the log file.

	To test it you can try adding

	pre_backup_script = env | grep ^BARMAN
	post_backup_script = env | grep ^BARMAN

	in your barman config and you'll see the variables on console.
