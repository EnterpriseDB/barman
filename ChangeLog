	Update the ChangeLog file

2015-09-15  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Prepared for 1.5.0 alpha 1

2015-09-09  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Converted man pages to Markdown

2015-09-08  Gianni Ciolli  <gianni.ciolli@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Some small fixes to the tutorial

2015-09-01  Francesco Canovai  <francesco.canovai@2ndquadrant.it>

	Updated spec file for RPM building

2015-09-04  Giuseppe Broccolo  <giuseppe.broccolo@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add barman-wal-restore script
	Add a simple bash script to be used as `restore_command`
	in a standby scenario, as fallback method. The script
	uses ssh to connect to the Barman server and requests
	the required WAL file for recovery.

	The script checks that destination path is not a directory.

2015-08-27  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Convert tutorial to Markdown

2015-08-28  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Manage options without '=' in PostgreSQL configuration files

2015-08-18  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Allow 'pre' retry hook scripts to stop the command
	Add EXIT_ABORT_STOP (63) and EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE (62) exit codes
	to control how a retry hook script is aborted.

	Termination of a retry hook script with EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE informs
	Barman to continue with its operations.

	By terminating a retry hook script with EXIT_ABORT_STOP, users
	request Barman to stop its main operation (i.e. backup or WAL archival).

	EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE is implemented by every retry hook script.

	EXIT_ABORT_STOP is currently implemented only with 'pre_backup_retry_script'
	and 'pre_archive_retry_script'.

	EXIT_ABORT_STOP is currently ignored by 'post_backup_retry_script' and
	'post_archive_retry_script', and its behaviour in these cases is
	identical to EXIT_ABORT_CONTINUE.

2015-08-21  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add flake8 tox environment

2015-08-18  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Documentation for 'barman_lock_directory'

2015-08-18  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Analyse include directives for PostgreSQL
	Check if PostgreSQL administrators take advantage of include
	directives and specify additional files. Include directives
	(include, include_if_exists, include_dir) are not supported
	in Barman for files that reside outside PGDATA.

	During backup, warn users and list the files that require
	manual backup. During recovery, warn users about the presence
	of include directives in PostgreSQL configuration.

2015-08-18  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Workaround for rsync on SUSE Linux
	Many thanks to Christoph Moench-Tegeder <christoph@2ndquadrant.de>
	for his workaround proposal. This fixes the outstanding issue
	on SUSE Linux - previously raised by issues #13 and #26.
	See also: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898513

2015-08-17  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Added copy_method option (fixed to rsync)

2015-08-06  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for 'retry' hook scripts for backup and WAL archiving
	A 'retry' hook script is a special kind of hook scripts that Barman
	tries to run indefinitely until it either returns a SUCCESS (0) or
	an ABORT (63) exit code.

	Safe hook scripts are executed immediately before (pre) and after (post)
	the command execution. Standard hook scripts are executed immediately
	before (pre) and after (post) the retry hook scripts.

	This patch adds support for pre/post retry hook scripts for backup
	and WAL archiving.

	The following four global/server configuration options have been added:

	* pre_backup_retry_script: executed before a backup
	* post_backup_retry_script: executed after a backup
	* pre_archive_retry_script: executed before a WAL archive operation
	* post_archive_retry_script: executed after a WAL archive operation

	By default, no retry hook script is executed. Environment variables
	are identical to the equivalent standard hook script.

2015-08-12  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Updated AUTHORS file

2014-05-29  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for the 'get-wal' command
	The 'barman get-wal' command allows users to fetch any WAL file
	from the archive of a specific server in Barman.

2015-08-21  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add simple Travis CI integration

2015-08-11  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Set version 1.5.0a1

2015-07-30  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Preserve Timeline history files. Fixes #70.
	Added check for the management of history files during the removal of a
	backup or during normal maintenance operations (cron).

2015-08-06  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Forbid the delete of a running backup
	Block the execution of a barman delete command on a backup that is in progress.
	Use locks to ensure that there are no running backups on that server.
	Otherwise check for the position of the backup to be deleted in the
	catalogue and its status: if it is the first backup and its status is STARTED or EMPTY,
	the backup is running and delete is forbidden.

2015-08-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Follow symlinks when checking directory paths
	Check conflicting paths in configuration files using canonical paths and
	following symlinks when necessary.

2015-07-13  Francesco Canovai  <francesco.canovai@2ndquadrant.it>

	Pin mock==1.0.1 for testing.
	In version 1.1.x mock has changed some behaviours and is currently
	incompatible with our unit tests.

2015-07-08  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Execute check() before starting a backup
	Execute the full suite of tests from barman check command before
	starting a backup. Skip the execution of a backup in case check
	fails.

	Add a strategy for managing the results of the checks. Now every
	check is properly logged as error (failure) or debug (success).

2015-07-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support code documentation using Sphinx
	Generate code documentation using Sphinx autodocs

	Properly support BackupInfo serialization in JSON format.

2015-07-01  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improved management of configuration in tests
	Improved and simplified the management of configurations in tests. Added
	a method for the creation of dictionaries containing all the keys that
	are usually present in a configuration. Updated tests accordingly.

2015-06-18  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Second part of the backup_executor module's refactor
	Refactored and streamlined the executor module. Introduced a specific
	class for physical backup with Rsync through Ssh, as well as a strategy
	pattern for the management of exclusive and concurrent backups (for
	backups from a standby).

2015-06-23  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Standard error management for server commands
	Standardised the process of managing errors with server commands in
	barman/cli.py. By default, inactive servers are skipped (without error)
	as well as temporarily disabled servers (with error). No distinction is
	made between calling a command with one server as target or with a list
	of them (including 'all'). Exceptions are check (no server is skipped,
	errors are returned only for active servers), cron (no error is ever
	returned), list-server and diagnose (both managing active/disabled
	servers with no errors). Inactive servers are the ones with 'active'
	option set to False. Disabled servers are the ones with internal
	directory conflicts (e.g. WALs directory = base backup directory).

2015-06-23  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Asciidoc support for man pages and tutorial

2015-06-16  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Added two basic unit tests.

2015-06-12  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add check for wal_level
	For better usability, warn users about setting a proper value
	for wal_level setting in PostgreSQL.

2015-05-14  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add check for conflicting paths in Barman's configuration
	Added controls for path-clash during the creation of Barman servers.
	If there are conflicting paths, Barman will disable those servers
	containing errors.
	If a potentially destructive command like "backup" is issued on a server
	containing conflicts, Barman exits with an error message.

2015-05-21  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Complete refactor of the 'recover' command
	The main 'recover' command has been completely refactored, through
	the creation of a separate module, called 'recovery_executor'.
	The RecoveryExecutor class now embodies both local and remote
	operations, laying the road for future improvements.

	This patch also fixes #68, by disabling dangerous settings in
	postgresql.auto.conf (available from PostgreSQL 9.4).

	Basic unit tests have been added.

2015-05-19  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Rename class Server to ServerConfig in barman.config module
	Previously both barman.config and barman.server modules had a Server
	class. The former has now been renamed to ServerConfig, hence removing
	the ambiguity.

2015-05-21  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix incompatibility with tox version >= 2

2015-05-08  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Make sure that even an EMPTY backup has a server set.

2015-05-07  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improve xlog.db integrity (Closes: #67)
	* Execute flush() and fsync() after writing a line in xlog.db
	* Execute fsync() on incoming directory after every WAL is archived

2015-04-13  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Remove unused 'server' argument from WalFile.from_xlogdb_line()
	This also fix regression in 'barman delete' command introduced with
	commit 7ac8fe9c41fd7e5636f370abdc92ca785057263e.

2015-04-13  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fix exception during error handling in barman recovery (Closes: #65)

2015-03-24  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Improved cache management of backups
	Streamlined the management of the cache of the backups.
	It is now possible to register and remove a backup from the cache.
	The cache structure has been simplified and now it is a simple
	dictionary of backups. Status filters are applied by the
	get_available_backups() method.
	Managed registration and removal of a backup in the cache
	during backup operations.

2015-03-02  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Create backup_executor module and refactor backup.
	Extract all the methods relative to the execution of a backup into a
	dedicated object.
	The RsyncBackupExecutor encapsulates the operation of backing up a
	remote server using rsync and ssh to copy files.

2015-03-27  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improved management of xlogb file
	The xlogdb file is now correctly fsynced when updated.
	Also, the rebuild-xlogdb command now operates on a temporary
	new file, which overwrites the main one when finished.

2015-03-27  Stefano Bianucci  <stefano.bianucci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add "active" configuration option for a server
	It is now possible to temporarily disable a server through
	the 'active' configuration option. Defined at server level
	as a boolean, when set to False the server is ignored by
	main operational commands such as cron, backup and recover.
	By default, it is set to True.

2015-03-20  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Modified Barman version following PEP 440 rules.
	Changed Barman version from 1.4.1-alpha1 to 1.4.1a1
	following PEP 440 rules.
	Adapted RPM build scripts to produce packages with
	the correct names.

2015-03-17  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fix computation of WAL production ratio
	The WAL file ratio reported in the 'show-backup' command output was wrong
	because it was considering only the number of WALS produced during the
	backup instead of the number of WALs produced until next backup.

2015-02-25  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fix for WAL archival stop working if first backup is EMPTY
	In some rare cases, if an empty backup has left by a failure during a
	backup, the cron could start trashing WAL files, as if there is no
	available backups.

	Closes: #64

2015-03-06  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Added 'barman_lock_directory' global option
	Barman now allows to specify the default directory for locks through
	the global option called 'barman_lock_directory', by default set to
	'barman_home'. Lock files will be created inside this directory.

	Names of lock files have been slightly changed. However, this won't
	affect users of Barman, unless you are relying on their locations and
	paths.

	This patch introduces four classes for managing lock files:
	GlobalCronLock, ServerBackupLock, ServerCronLock and ServerXLOGDBLock.

2015-02-03  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	New backup directory structure
	Inside the backup directory the 'pgdata' has been renamed to 'data'.
	Tablespaces, if present, are stored into individual directories alongside
	the 'data' directory.
	During backup and recovery operations, tablespaces are copied individually
	using a separate rsync command.

2015-02-12  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Improve backup delete command
	Improve robustness and error reporting of backup delete command

	Update the ChangeLog file

	Prepared documentation for version 1.4.0-alpha1

2015-01-11  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Store deduplication effects for incremental backup
	When incremental backup is enabled and uses hard links
	(reuse_backup = link), output of 'backup' command reports
	the effects of deduplication. The metrict is stored along
	the backup.info file in the 'deduplicated_size' field.

	IMPORTANT: this metric refers to the increment in size
	of the current backup from the previous backup and reflects
	only the situation at backup time.

2015-01-10  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Prepared version 1.4.0-alpha1

	any failure as error instead of exception

2014-12-22  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Unit tests for BackupInfo object

2014-12-24  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Change the way BackupInfo are created for testing
	Merge the method build_test_backup_info and the mock_backup_info.
	Now we use real BackupInfo objects instead of a Mock

2011-12-07  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Incremental base backup implementation
	Add support for reuse_backup global/server option, accepting
	three possible values:

	* off:  no incremental backup support (default)
	* copy: uses the last available backup as source (preventing unmodified
	        files from being copied)
	* link: same as copy but uses hard links on destination, if the filesystem
	        on the backup server allows it (reducing the occupied space)

	Add support for command line '--reuse-backup' option (default: link).

2014-12-24  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Improve robustness of retention policy unit tests

2014-12-16  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Fixes retention policies delete bug (#58)
	The method responsible for deleting obsolete backup in
	retention policies enforement, will not raise anymore
	the 'NoneType object is not iterable'. This prevents
	barman from terminating abruptly.

2014-11-28  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.com>

	Pass list of available backups to retention policy code

	Changed behaviour if pg_ident.conf is missing from an error to a warning

2014-10-22  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Remove code to replace output stream when quiet
	Previously the '-q' option was handled replacing the standard output
	stream with one which trows away averything it gets. Now it is not
	needed anymore because we haver a proper output module.

2014-09-26  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Remove all remaining output done by yield
	Migrate all the remaining part using yeld to do output to using the new
	output module.

2014-10-07  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Ignore fsync EINVAL errors on directories (#55)
	On some filesystem doing a fsync on a directory raises an EINVAL error.

	Change default LockFile behaviour to raise if fails acquisition

2014-09-01  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Invoke WAL maintenance after a successful backup
	* At the end of the 'barman backup' command, maintenance operations
	  are automatically started for successful backups (equivalent to
	  manually executing a 'barman cron' command, just for that server)

	* Trashing of unuseful WALs (part of 'barman cron') has been changed
	  as follows:

	  * in case of one or more backups, delete WAL files older than
	    the start WAL of the first backup
	  * otherwise, trash WAL files in case of exclusive backup server
	    (that is, not concurrent)

2014-09-03  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Remove redundant server argument from HookScriptRunner.env_from_wal_info()

2014-08-27  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndquadrant.it>

	* Remove 'full_path' attribute in WalInfoFile
	* Add 'relpath()' method to WalInfoFile, which returns the
	  relative path of a WAL file within the 'wals_directory' directory
	* Add 'fullpath()' method to WalInfoFile, which returns the
	  full path of a WAL file within a server installation (requires
	  a server object)

	Support for 'last_backup_max_age'
	This new global/server option allows administrators
	to set the max age of the last backup, making it easier
	to detect any issues with periodical backup execution.

2014-06-18  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Support for "smart" incremental recovery
	Avoid invoking rsync with --checksum option during recovery,
	while maintaining the same level of safety by splitting the
	copy operation in multiple steps.
	Barman will only use the --checksum option on files having identical
	time and size that have been modified after the start of the backup.
	This change greatly improves the speed of "incremental" recovery.

	Minor changes:
	- disable --checksum even for backup. During a backup the rsync
	  destination directory is empty, so it is safe to go with a plain
	  rsync
	- Put a ".barman-recover.info" with backup metadata inside the
	  destination directory during recover.

	Use Postgres' server time for both begin_time and end_time
	Minor changes:
	- make sure exceptions during backup are logged with stacktraces
	- commit on disk the backup status just after issuing the PostgreSQL
	  start_backup command

	Change version to 1.3.3-alpha.1

2014-06-09  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Fix for #43 recovery.conf not copied on remote recovery

2014-05-08  Giulio Calacoci  <giulio.calacoci@2ndquadrant.it>

	Retry option for base backup
	If a network error happens during rsync, add the ability
	to retry a defined number of time.

	Two options have been added:
	 * basebackup_retry_times: INT (> 0, default 1)
	     maximum number or retry before giving up
	 * basebackup_retry_sleep: INT (> 0, default 10)
	     wait time (seconds) before retrying, after an error

	27: Addresses potential corruption of WAL xlog.db files.
	In barman.lockfile.release() the file is unlinked (deleted). This effectively
	nullifies any future attempts to lock the file by a blocking process by deleting
	the open file table entry upon which the flock is based.

	This commit removes the unlink and instead unlocks the file and then closes the file
	descriptor leaving the lock file and open file table entry intact.

2013-08-22  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

2012-12-08  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add retention status to show-backup and list-backup commands

	Auto-management of retention policies for base backups
	Using the report() method for retention policies, enforce retention
	policy through cron (if policy mode is 'auto'), by deleting OBSOLETE
	backups.

	Retention status and report() method for retention policies
	Created the following states for retention policies:
	VALID, OBSOLETE, NONE and POTENTIALLY_OBSOLETE (an
	object which is OBSOLETE but cannot be removed
	automatically due to minimum_redundancy requirements).
	Created the report() method for the retention policy
	base class, which exected the _backup_report() method
	for base backups and the _wal_report() method for WAL
	retention policies (currently not enforced).
	The report method iterates through the DONE backups
	and according to the retention policy, classifies
	the backup. RedundancyRetentionPolicy uses the number
	of backups, RecoveryWindowRetentionPolicy uses the
	time window and the recoverability point concept.

	Integrated minimum_redundancy with "barman check"

	Initialisation of retention policies for a server
	Added the _init_retention_policies() method in the
	Server class constructor, which integrates with
	the new RetentionPolicy classes and performs
	syntax checking.
	Integrated retention policies with log, 'barman check'
	and 'barman status'.

	String representation conforms to retention syntax
	The string representation produces now a syntax-valid
	retention policy configuration string.
	The previous __str__ method has been renamed into debug()
	SimpleWALRetentionPolicy objects are now created from
	the server's main retention policy by the factory class.

2012-12-07  Gabriele Bartolini  <gabriele.bartolini@2ndQuadrant.it>

	Add the global/server option minimum_redundancy. Check it is >= 0. Guarantees that when delete is performed (or retention policies are enforced), this is the minimum number of backups to be kept for that server.

	Add support for retention_policy_mode global/server option which defines the method for enforcing retention policies (currently only "auto", in future versions "manual" will be allowed)

	Added first stub of retention policy classes

	Started version 1.2.0

2012-08-17  Marco Nenciarini  <marco.nenciarini@2ndquadrant.it>

	Add pre/post backup hook scripts definition (Closes: #7)
	Add the possibility to manage hook scripts before and after a base
	backup. Add the global (overridden per server) configuration options
	called:

	* pre_backup_script: executed before a backup
	* post_backup_script: executed after a backup

	Use the environment to pass at least the following variabiles:

	* BARMAN_BACKUP_DIR: backup destination directory
	* BARMAN_BACKUP_ID: ID of the backup
	* BARMAN_CONFIGURATION: configuration file used by barman
	* BARMAN_PHASE: 'pre' or 'post'
	* BARMAN_SERVER: name of the server

	The script definition is passed to the shell and can return any exit code.

	Barman won't perform any exit code check. It will simply log the result in the log file.

	To test it you can try adding

	pre_backup_script = env | grep ^BARMAN
	post_backup_script = env | grep ^BARMAN

	in your barman config and you'll see the variables on console.
