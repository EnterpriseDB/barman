To generate new server controller/model code from the spec,

0. Make sure you have `openapi-generator` installed on your computer

1. From the root `barman` directory, run
`openapi-generator generate -i barman_api/spec/barman_api.yaml -o barman_api -t barman_api/generator_templates -g python-flask`

It will also generate two empty directories - `test` and `openapi`. You can delete or ignore these.

2. Modify or add to files in `barman_api/logic` as needed to implement the updated endpoint logic.
If new routing between the autogenerated controllers and the logic controllers is needed, modify 
`barman_api/logic/adapter.py` to accomodate.
