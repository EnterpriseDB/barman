To generate new server controller/model code from the spec,

- Make sure you have `openapi-generator` and `black` installed on your computer

- Set the env variable `PYTHON_POST_PROCESS_FILE` to where the `black` executable is installed

- From the root `barman` directory, run
`openapi-generator generate --enable-post-process-file -i barman_api/spec/barman_api.yaml -o barman_api -t barman_api/generator_templates -g python-flask`

It will also generate two empty directories - `test` and `openapi`. You can delete or ignore these.

You may also need to clean up unused imports in generated files to make flake8 happy. Not all controllers will need all the default imports. In the future, it may be worthwhile to try to mess with the templates to avoid this manual step, but for now I don't think we know enough about what future controllers/models will look like for it not to be wasted effort.

- Modify or add to files in `barman_api/logic` as needed to implement the updated endpoint logic.
If new routing between the autogenerated controllers and the logic controllers is needed, modify 
`barman_api/logic/adapter.py` to accomodate.
