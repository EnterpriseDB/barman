To generate new server controller/model code from the spec,

- Make sure you have `openapi-generator` and `black` installed on your computer

- Set the env variable `PYTHON_POST_PROCESS_FILE` to where the `black` executable is installed

- From the root `barman` directory, run
`openapi-generator generate --enable-post-process-file -i barman_api/spec/barman_api.yaml -o barman_api -t barman_api/generator_templates -g python-flask`

It will also generate two empty directories - `test` and `openapi`. You can delete or ignore these.

- Modify or add to files in `barman_api/logic` as needed to implement the updated endpoint logic.
If new routing between the autogenerated controllers and the logic controllers is needed, modify 
`barman_api/logic/adapter.py` to accomodate.
