# Generate sphinx documentation

Generate barman code documentation using Sphinx autodoc

## Prerequisites

Install the python modules required to build the documentation
by executing, from the root directory of Barman:

``` bash
pip install -r sphinx/requirements.txt
```

## Documentation generation

From the root folder of Barman, launch:

sphinx/generate_docs.sh
```


### `generate_docs.sh` options

Is possible to use a different path to the barman source files
directory (default: the current barman source directory) passing it
as argument to the `generate_docs.sh` script.

``` bash
sphinx/generate_docs.sh <path_to_alternative_barman_source_dir>
```

It's also possible to pass the target format (default: `html`)
to the generate_docs.sh script using the -t option followed by
one of the available formats:

*  html       to make standalone HTML files
